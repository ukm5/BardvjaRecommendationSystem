particl in turbul unlik spheric particl high aspect ratio particl such as rod and disk have an orient depend to their particl translat and orient a tion dynam there have been simul of neutral buoyant particl in homogen isotrop turbul hit and of translat in a howev there have been no direct numer simul dn of settl in turbul that captur the effect of inertia as a two way coupl interact between d and

particl in turbul and ha been review by vo th and sold at i how ever at larger particl size the effect of inertia are more profound and cannot be neglect most studi on non spheric particl in turbul have neglect the effect of torqu due to inertia it ha been rec ogni zed in atmospher scienc literatur that inerti torqu caus horizont align of ice crystal in cloud turbul inerti torqu caus slender particl to sediment with their long axi perpendicular to graviti in thi work we propos a settl paramet s f that determin the rel in of turbul and inertia we then proceed to show the transit of non spheric particl from isotrop distribut at high turbul s f to horizont align at high settl rate s f instead of consid spheroid particl we introduc particl to facilit our theori and simul approach particl are structur capabl of captur d if fe rent symmetri form by connect or slender rod togeth by do so we exploit the slender bodi theori to model and thu these complic geometri for exampl three connect to form a co planar structur of equal separ that we refer to as a triad captur the symmetri of a disk similarli one might for mother shape and structur by connect ing and introduc rigid bodi constraint anoth motiv to studi particl is becaus of the eas in fabric these structur use d print technolog to perform experi a primari object of our simul and theori is to eventu compar to experiment observ of triad settl in homogen isotrop turbul hit we have in thi regard develop simpl model base of slender bodi theori captur the effect of inertia as a torqu given by k hayat and cox for high aspect ratio particl to overcom the comput d if of perform dn of in hit a stochast model of turbul veloc gradient of giri maj i and pope is chosen in section and a detail descript of the model and assumpt made to facilit the simul and theori is discuss there is a brief d is cu sion of the simul befor extend the same to triad in section final the simul and theori is compar to experiment in section chapter theori and result motiv anisotrop particl settl unlik isotrop particl due to their prefer set t ling orient while the settl dynam of a sphere is determin by it translat veloc for a it orient play a critic role in determin the direct and rate of settl thi differ is notabl for a settl in a quiescent non inerti in the absenc of inertia like in the case of stoke re w where w is the magnitud of particl veloc l is particl length and is the kinemat viscos of the the settl trajectori for a is determin by it initi orient it is observ that a in stoke ha a maximum settl veloc at it vertic orient which is twice it minimum veloc observ data horizont orient thi lack of chang in orient or trajectori dure settl is attribut to the lack of inertia at these regim in the presenc of inertia howev a tend to achiev a broadsid align in other word it mayb note that the horizont orient of settl is the onli stabl orient of settl for a in the presenc of inertia thi broadsid align is due to the presenc of an inerti torqu that is a result of particl orient and settl veloc k hayat and cox have determin the lead order contribut to thi torqu at the limit of weak inertia re the object of thi work is to provid a theoret framework to tackl orient dynam of and other anisotrop particl settl in turbul it is to be expect that thi competit of inerti and turbul torqu will result in an orient distribut for such particl in cloud ice crystal tend to achiev orient that the r of electromagnet ra di at ion a nice crystal ha a planar hexagon shape and symmetri similar to a disk sunlight is the primari sourc of energi to earth and serv as an import paramet in weather model understand the orient of ice crystal in cloud would help determin the fraction of light that enter the at mo sphere the r of electromagnet radiat is also of motiv to airplan to develop better navig and frost predict techniqu in thi section simpl particl model for and geometri that captur disk like symmetri are develop these model are then coupl to la gran gian stochast model of turbul to simul the particl orient distribut by assum the limit of weak inertia re one may exploit the inerti torqu at lead order of k hayat and cox to cap ture the effect of inertia it is expect that the experi two primari contribut to it orient dynam a random iz ation due to the stochast turbul veloc and a broadsid align due to in er tia through the section ahead we provid simul and analyt result support thi claim and also deriv paramet that help in describ the orient distribut quantit lagrangian model of turbul befor we delv into the particl model and scale argument it is import to describ the motiv for select the turbul model we have in thi work as mention the object of thi work ha been to develop simpl particl model that are abl to describ the salient featur respons for the interest orient distribut to provid a complet descript of the orient distribut of these high aspect ratio particl such as and rod one must solv the entir equat in other word a direct numer simul dn in the presenc of particl must be solv thi is a rather exhaust process consid the comput expens and d if involv there is a lack of easi to use opensourc dn solver that are easi to implement and modifi also inerti torqu experienc by is a result of two way coupl dynam captur such effect is rather com p lica ted and yet to be success implement in the presenc of turbul previou studi have therefor either ignor turbul or inertia to simul the orient dynam of to overcom thi d if cult y but at the sametim to provid a framework to understand the orient distribut of we have chosen stochast model of turbul to pro v idea tempor distribut of the in thi regard there are differ model of turbul avail but in thi work a lagrangian stochast model of homogen isotrop turbul of giri maj i and pope wa chosen thi model provid a tempor distribut of veloc gradient captur the non linear term of navier stoke equat exactli and ha paramet such as the pseudo dissip relax time of pseudo dissip and strain rate and moment of veloc gradient tune to imit the dn of y eung and pope high aspect ratio particl dynam is depend on the correl of vortic and shear and thi model doe a good job of captur it make it suitabl for our object of simul the orient distribut of by approxim the to be sub kolmogorov it mayb assum that the particl experi a local stochast linear in turbul at slow settl rate it is fair to assum that particl follow trajectori justifi the choic of a lagrangian model of turbul as alreadi mention giri maj i and pope model the non linear term in navier stoke equat exactli and captur the correl of vortic and shear quit well the model is base on the log normal distribut of pseudo dissip observ in dn of y eung and pope chen and pope have model pseudo dissip as au hlen beck or nste in process of diffus thi model ha been further extend to obtain a stochast equat of veloc gra die nt the simul gener a tempor distribut of

giri maj i and pope small settl in turbul the idea of simul small enough is motiv from the fact that we intend to use lagrangian stochast model of veloc gradient to describ tur bul en ce for a small enough particl of sub kolmogorov length scale l the ber experi a local linear in a homogen isotrop tur bu lent w thi would be a randomli vari isotrop in the ab senc of ani inertia a particl would align in the direct of minimum shear give anisotrop distribut of orient howev inertia break thi degeneraci and align the particl horizont creat ad is tri bu tion of orient due to compet effect thi competit of preferenti align and random iz ation of orient can be understood in term of two timescal there is a timescal over which the particl respond to the ed die of turbul o l and anoth for respons to inertia that we shall as sed a particl of length l would respond primarili to an eddi of similar size and ani eddi smaller than thi depend on the rate of settl and turbul intens re we can then argu the rel en ce of these two effect a settl paramet s f is then as the ratio of these two timescal to paramet ize the domain over which one may studi the orient distribut s f l sed for a sub kolmogorov particl thi eddi turnov time would correspond to the kolmogorov scale of turbul a heurist of the timescal over which a particl respond to inerti torqu sed is obtain as the invers rotat rate of a particl at in the absenc of turbul the angl is as that between the axi of symmetri and graviti for a it is the angl between the orient vector and graviti for a disk or triad it is the angl between the normal to plane of particl and graviti a practic of s f for sub kolmogorov particl is then obtain as s f sed a settl particl of length l disturb a volum of o l upon compar the particl and mass that are disturb one obtain p f l d from thi relat it mayb notic that for high aspect ratio particl when ever the particl and densiti are compar the particl inertia isn eg lig i ble compar to that of the thi allow one to neglect particl inertia and assum that the particl experi no net forc or torqu ani extern forc must be then balanc by drag and lift forc gener due to rel veloc between

when s f the particl respond quickli to the kolmogorov timescal or turbul as a result the tend to align in anisotrop manner due to the stochast natur of isotrop turbul thi isotrop orient d is tri but

mayb describ as almost horizont with as light wiggl rapid settl limit of small in thi subsect an analyt predict for the varianc of the orient in the rapid settl limit s f sed is present thi indic that the relax of orient toward it equilibrium horizont align oc cur much more rapidli than the kolmogorov timescal it can be seen that thi limit correspond to one in which the time s amp w for a to sampl

the high sampl rate we see that the respond to inerti torqu quickli and therefor remain in a horizont orient allow for the orient to be analyt obtain from a quasi steadi state balanc of in er ti al rotat and turbul shear it should be also note that sed is a respons to the inerti torqu due to settl and is of consequ onli in that direct as a result the quasi steadi for would exist in the direct of settl that we have chosen to be direct in our analysi we then proceed to determin the rotat rate of whose orient sex hi bit small deviat from the horizont plane so that h p i where the axi is parallel to graviti we begin with an altern mobil form of eq written use einstein notat w i mg ln l ij p i p j j mg ln l i p i p where w min mg ln l for h p i it can be seen that w i p i w p mg ln l p w min p

simul we have p p thu p t i ij p t j p t i s j l p t j p t l where p t i denot the transvers compon i of the orient vec tor indic that the orient sampl the plane normal to graviti by turbul shear motion thi will lead to anisotrop distribut of or ien t ation within the plane sinc sed the motion within the plane will be slow compar to the e qui lib ration of the compon of orient in the settl direct therefor will exist a quasi static equilibrium becaus sed s amp thu p w min p ln p p w min ln p i ij p t j p s j l p t j p t l sinc p we further simplifi the abov equat by balanc the second and

assum h p t j p t n j n i to be the correspond product of mean of veloc gradient h j n i and orient h p t j p t n i dy ad thi is a larg valid assumpt in the rapid settl limit as sed s amp and as a

fourth order isotrop tensor whose form can deduc use the properti of symmetri and continu as shown in to obtain h s ij s mn i s im jn in j m ij mn h ij mn i h im jn in j m i where s h s ij s ij i and

earlier thu we have for the rapid settl limit the follow relat character the departur of orient from the horizont plane due to turbul h p i h co i s f f howev in our simul we use a lagrangian model of veloc gradient instead of a particl frame model of turbul at the rapid settl limit while the strong inerti torqu tri to maintain a horizont orient within the plane the orient continu to chang at a kolmogorov timescal thi lead to a correl of orient and veloc gradient in horizont plane as a result our simul give asymptot s differ from eq by a factor correspond to h p t i p t j i j i in our simul we observ thi factor to be around make the asymptot h co i s f f s f f in fig we compar our simul to the origin theoret asymptot of eq and to the correct relat in eq consid the agreement of theori and simul it is import to recogn the valid and util of our assumpt triad settl in turbul in thi section the theori and simul are extend to triad arm ram particl such that all three arm lie within the same plane and at equal separ we model particl as structur form of s connect togeth to undergo rigid bodi dynam thu by treat the triad as three join togeth the forc and torqu balanc on the triad are x n h f n drag f n graviti i x n l ln p n p n w n m n g x n f l ln w n p n w n p n l ln p n p n rel l ln p n s p n p n f n drag where l is the arm length note that eq for triad ha an addit contribut due to the dragon individu arm f n drag l ln p n p n w n compar to the torqu balanc of in eq from the symmetri of the particl it mayb shown that the contribut to torqu due to drag from triad veloc w c sum to zero and as a result onli rel veloc of arm with respect to triad center contribut to the torqu balanc the orient of each arm is by p n and the orient of a particl is by p which is perpendicular to the plane span by the arm and is the unit vector along the axi of symmetri in the low reynold number limit thi particl model predict the same ratio of sediment veloc for triad as is known to appli to thin disk e g w d max w d min sinc the of p is differ for triad than for the of w max and w min ha also chang and now w d max j w j and w d min j w j note the differ in for and disk in eq and eq thi model neglect hydro dynam interact among the rod the of hydro dynam interact on the drag and the torqu due to rel rotat and strain motion are of higher order in ln howev hydro dynam in ter action would the inerti torqu at the same order of magnitud as the term retain and the present model that includ onli the torqu on each arm act independ is like an underestim of the triad inerti torqu as a result upon solv eq for a horizont triad we notic that the minimum veloc of a triad is the same as that of a horizont in an actual triad the arm interact would appear as inertia effect and cannot be captur in our simpl model thi would requir ns at the least when compar with experiment measur the inerti term base on the observ rotat rate of a larg triad will correct for thi discrep to avoid confus though the triad minimum veloc w min is the same as that for a we will be refer to the latter as w f min it is import to note that our theori appli to a case where the reynold number is small re in thi limit the rotat of the triad toward hori zonta l orient is a result of weak inertia the competit between turbul shear and inerti rotat lead to intermedi orient dist rib u t ion between isotrop and broadsid align when g w f min and re but the settl paramet s f f re g o in order to ensur these condit in our simul especi at higher settl rate s f we scale our forc and torqu balanc equat thi approach of

section an asymptot express for the varianc of the angl between normal to plane of triad and the direct of graviti is obtain the analysi involv a similar argument where the triad is approxim to be in a quasi steadi hori zonta l orient allow the angular veloc that would rotat the triad out of plane to be neglect the asymptot express for a triad is qua lita t iv eli similar to that of a with a power law depend howev we see a differ of coe fine q h s in i h i s f f we do not see ani correl of the orient vector and veloc gradient for triad unlik in becaus the normal to the plane of the particl would align vertic or along graviti at rapid settl limit thi behavior is expect to appear for ani disk like symmetr structur unlik the ori ent ation rate that had two time sale associ with it depend on the com pone nt the normal to triad and disk align vertic due to the strong inerti torqu to maintain uniform in our of s f were vert to the empir def in it ion from previou section we had s f as the the ratio of timescal of respons to turbul and the inerti torqu by do so we obtain an empir settl paramet for triad as s t f sed while for the sub kolmogorov triad like those in simul the respons time to turbul remain the kolmogorov timescal the timescal of re sp on seto inerti torqu for triad cannot be easili determin analyt thi is becaus unlik the rotat rate of a at a triad at ha mul tip le state due to individu arm orient thu to determin a timescal of respons to inerti torqu that is independ of the arm orient within the plane or the angl between arm project to plane and axi we need to calcul the reciproc of an averag p sed thu sed hj p sed ji an analyt integr within a plane at to graviti is cumbersom and to avoid that we have calcul an averag rotat rate within that plane use simul we thu have an inerti timescal of respons sed ln w min give thu a settl paramet s t f w min ln it would be conveni to reduc the theoret asymptot in eq to fun c t ion of the empir settl paramet s t f in order to do so we determin the ratio of the two settl paramet to obtain s f f s t f substitut the abov express for s f f into the theoret asymptot of eq h s in i h i s t f where s t f is the empir

involv either turbul or inertia effect shin and koch have for exampl simul neutral buoyant in turbul thi assumpt avoid ani need to includ inertia as the dragon is necessari for creat ani inerti torqu or coupl of and particl phase interact similarli work that do consid inertia and it effect on dynam have chosen to ignor the effect of turbul in their calcul due to a lack of dn solver and the eas of use a stochast model over solv the entir navier stoke e qua tion thi approach of includ the inertia effect in the particl model ha been conveni and use howev it is necessari to remind that such an approxim is onli valid when we are consid weak inertia o re we have appli thi model to and triad to understand the util of our approach while remain the basic unit for applic of thi approach by extend thi model to triad we have shown how one mayb abl to model complic particl as connect togeth thi in away cor respond to the approach adapt by experi a list to fabric shape use d print where rod are connect togeth giri maj i and pope model homogen isotrop turbul hit tur bu len ce as a stochast veloc gradient use u hlen beck or nste in process the salient featur of thi model is that it captur the nonlinear term in the navier stoke equat respons for inerti effect exactli it use the tempor diffus equat of log normal pseudo dissip of chen and pope as a start point to develop a stochast differenti equat of veloc gra die nt tensor the model is then tune and constrain to match the pseudo dissip distribut and higher veloc gradient moment observ in the dn simul of y eung and pope as a result the model captur the correl observ in dn between the vortic and shear thi cou p ling of shear and vortic is import for success simul of or ien t ation dynam sinc the model captur onli the lead order effect of inertia it is im port ant to realiz that our simul area best represent of weak inertia re u and weak turbul g u and for sub kolmogorov particl howev we consid the entir spectrum of rel settl

our simul and theori for in section and we have the import region of orient depend on the rel of inertia and turbul at low s f we observ from fig that the orient is by the turbul strongli and as are sul t the particl respond to the stochast veloc gradient rel quickli while follow a lagrangian trajectori thi result in anisotrop distribut of the particl orient as the particl settl veloc increas there is a larger of inertia lead to a horizont align of the thi appear as an asymptot decreas in the particl orient varianc in fig thi decreas in varianc ha a s f behaviour at rapid settl limit as expect from theori at thi regim the particl respond quickli to the inerti torqu resist deviat away from the horizont due to turbul howev for thi appear as a resist onli in the compon of orient and as a result the compon continu to respond to tur bu len ce timescal thi lead to a partial correl of particl orient and veloc gradient in our simul in our theori we assum the particl ori ent ation to complet de correl from the at the rapid settl limit for we add a factor of correl to our theoret asymptot as shown in eq to compar to simul in fig we have extend thi idea from to triad in section where we model the triad as three co planar constrain by rigid bodi dynam while thi is a rudimentari model that neglect ani arm to arm interact thi model captur the essenti featur and of the two import time scale involv by a settl paramet as the ratio of two timescal sed and like we did for we have simul the orient dist rib u tion of triad settl in turbul as shown in fig like in the case for the simul captur the sub kolmogorov dynam at weak inertia and weak turbul but for differ rel strength through s f we deter mine the timescal of respons to inertia sed as an invers rotat rate at by simul the rotat due to inertia torqu in a quiescent us ing the empir of s f we have a gener settl paramet that mayb use to compar orient dynam across particl and re in fig we compar our simul of and triad perform at re and we see that thi of s f help in identifi a univers power law relat of asymptot at the rapid settl limit it is commend that our simpl model is use in gener simul and theoret asymptot s that are valid across differ and particl paramet as shown in fig final we compar our simul and theori to the experiment result of kr amel in section as expect the experi are not restrict by the assumpt made in theori or simul the particl are no longer sub kolmogorov and there is more than just lead order effect captur how ever by ensur a similar de of s f is use we are abl to compar our simul to the experi in fig as can be seen our simul captur the trend and transit seen in experi well the differ in rapid settl asymptot coe f observ mayb attribut to the lim i tat ion and assumpt in our model for exampl the experi contain particl where the arm are not independ of each other ' we be li eve these arm interact and other higher order effect of inertia might be respons for thi differ to verifi these detail through simul one must perform dn of and triad it must be also remind that we have use a lagrangian model of turbul while thi mayb easili at the low settl limit s f we argu that at s f the particl respond to inertia quickli and as a result the frame of refer we choos for tur bu lent veloc gradient is inconsequenti howev as observ from our simul and theori comparison in fig a particl frame model of veloc gradient that involv the particl settl rate is necessari also at s f o these argument are no longer valid and one must use a particl frame model of turbul but it is import to note that our approach is still capabl of captur the trend observ in experi at all s f to conclud we would like to reiter that our model is a simpl descript of high aspect ratio particl captur the import contribut to their dynam due to turbul and inertia the model is valid for sub kolmogorov particl l settl under weak inertia and weak turbul we have howev through our simul and theori captur the

ice crystal in cloud turbul inerti torqu caus slender particl to sediment with their long axi perpendicular to graviti in thi work we propos a settl paramet s f that determin the rel in of turbul and

like in the case of stoke re w where w is the magnitud of particl veloc l is particl length and is the kinemat viscos of the the settl trajectori for a is determin by it initi orient it is observ that a in stoke ha a maximum settl veloc at it vertic orient which is twice it minimum veloc observ data horizont orient thi lack of chang in orient or trajectori dure settl is attribut to the lack of inertia at these regim in the presenc of inertia howev a tend to achiev a broadsid align in other word it mayb note that the horizont orient of settl is the onli stabl orient of settl for a in the presenc of inertia thi broadsid align is due to the presenc of an inerti torqu that is a result of particl orient and settl veloc k hayat and cox have determin the lead order contribut to thi torqu at the limit of weak inertia re the object of thi work is to provid a theoret framework to tackl orient dynam of and other anisotrop particl settl in turbul it is to be expect that thi competit of inerti and turbul torqu will result in an orient distribut for such particl in cloud ice crystal tend to achiev orient that the r of electromagnet ra di at ion a nice crystal ha a planar hexagon shape and symmetri similar to a disk sunlight is the primari sourc of energi to earth and serv as an import paramet in weather model understand the orient of ice crystal in cloud would help determin the

geometri that captur disk like symmetri are develop these model are then coupl to la gran gian stochast model of turbul to simul the particl orient distribut by assum the limit of weak inertia re one may exploit the inerti torqu at lead order of k hayat and cox to cap ture the effect of inertia it is expect that the experi two primari contribut to it orient dynam a random iz ation due to the stochast turbul veloc and a broadsid align due to in er tia through the section ahead we provid simul and analyt result support thi claim and also deriv paramet that help in describ the orient

object of thi work ha been to develop simpl particl model that are abl to describ the salient featur respons for the interest orient distribut to provid a complet descript of the orient distribut of these high aspect ratio particl such as and rod one must solv the entir equat in other word a direct numer simul dn in the presenc of particl must be solv thi is a rather exhaust process consid the comput expens and d if involv there is a lack of easi to use opensourc dn solver that are easi to implement and modifi also inerti torqu experienc by is a result of two way coupl dynam captur such effect is rather com p lica ted and yet to be success implement in the presenc of turbul previou studi have therefor either ignor turbul or inertia to simul the orient dynam of to overcom thi d if cult y but at the sametim to provid a framework to understand the orient distribut of we have chosen stochast model of turbul to pro v idea tempor distribut of the in thi regard there are differ model

particl dynam is depend on the correl of vortic and shear and thi model doe a good job of captur it make it suitabl for our object of simul the orient distribut of by approxim the to be sub kolmogorov it mayb assum that the particl experi a local stochast linear in turbul at slow settl rate it is fair to assum that particl follow trajectori justifi the choic of a lagrangian model of turbul as alreadi mention giri maj i and pope model the non linear term in navier stoke equat exactli and captur the correl of vortic and shear quit well the model is base on the log normal distribut of pseudo

hold the same as in the origin paper of giri maj i and pope small settl in turbul the idea of simul small enough is motiv from the fact that we intend to use lagrangian stochast model of veloc

settl and turbul intens re we can then argu the rel en ce of these two effect a settl paramet s f is then as the ratio of these two timescal to paramet ize the domain over which one may studi the orient distribut s f l sed for a sub kolmogorov particl thi eddi turnov time would correspond to the kolmogorov scale of turbul a heurist of the timescal over which a particl respond to inerti torqu

use a lagrangian model of veloc gradient instead of a particl frame model of turbul at the rapid settl limit while the strong inerti torqu tri to maintain a horizont orient within the plane the orient

j i j i in our simul we observ thi factor to be around make the asymptot h co i s f f s f f in fig we compar our simul to the origin theoret asymptot of eq and to the correct relat in eq consid the agreement of theori and simul it is import to recogn the valid and util of our assumpt triad settl in turbul in thi section the theori and simul are extend to triad arm ram particl such that all three arm lie within the same plane and at equal separ we model particl as structur form of s connect togeth to undergo rigid bodi dynam thu by treat the triad as three join togeth the forc and torqu balanc

triad veloc w c sum to zero and as a result onli rel veloc of arm with respect to triad center contribut to the torqu balanc the orient of each arm is by p n and the orient of a particl is by p which is perpendicular to the plane span by the arm and is the unit vector along the axi of symmetri in the low reynold number limit thi particl model predict the same ratio of sediment veloc for triad as

dynam in ter action would the inerti torqu at the same order of magnitud as the term retain and the present model that includ onli the torqu on each arm act independ is like an underestim of the triad inerti torqu as a result upon solv eq for a horizont triad we notic that the minimum veloc of a triad is the same as that of a horizont in an actual triad the arm interact would appear as inertia effect and cannot be captur in our simpl model thi would requir ns at the least when compar with experiment measur the inerti term base on the observ rotat rate of a larg triad will correct for thi discrep to avoid confus though the triad minimum veloc w min is the same as that for a we will be refer to the latter as w f min it is import to note that our theori appli to a case where the reynold number is small re in thi limit the rotat of the triad toward hori zonta l orient is a result of weak inertia the competit between turbul shear and inerti rotat lead to intermedi orient dist rib u t

of the simul at differ horizont veloc are shown as black circl s f in simul is base of invers rotat rate of triad at and kolmogorov shear rate similar to the approach use in experi and simul it must be rememb that the model is a simpl de scrip tion of triad as three connect and constrain to perform rigid bodi dynam without ani arm to arm interact in the experi thi is most not true as there is go to be interact between arm while the effect of such interact are not thought of in thi work we expect them to be critic and it would warrant dn simul that allow for two way coupl interact howev it is commend that we observ agreement between the differ result while captur the import trend qualit and quantit to some extent it is also interest to note that by the settl paramet in term of two timescal base of particl rotat due to turbul and inertia we have develop a robust settl paramet s f and observ a s f asymptot at the rapid settl limit across differ and studi the slight mismatch that we see in fig between the ex peri ment s and simul theori mayb attribut to the simplic of the model and disregard of ani arm to arm interact chapter conclus the object of thi work wa to develop a model for

simul have an aspect ratio of same as the particl in the ex peri ment s of stefan kr amel that we compar to in section thi is a high enough aspect ratio to use slender bodi theori our model is a lead

perform in the past there is a lack of simul involv two way coupl interact of d and fluid in er tia is critic to orient dynam and appear as a result of two way coupl interact between and for exampl the broadsid align ment of high aspect ratio particl that is respons for break the degen e raci of turbul random iz ation is due to inertia in a dn simul these effect mayb captur by consid the effect

tackl thi conundrum by consid situat involv either turbul or inertia effect shin and koch have for exampl simul neutral buoyant in turbul thi assumpt avoid ani need to includ inertia as the dragon is necessari for creat ani inerti torqu or coupl of and particl phase interact similarli work that do consid inertia and it effect on dynam have chosen to ignor the effect of turbul in their calcul due to a lack of dn solver and the eas of use a stochast model over solv the entir navier stoke e qua tion thi approach of includ the inertia effect in the particl model ha been conveni and use howev it is necessari to remind that such an approxim is onli valid when we are consid weak inertia o re we have appli thi model to and triad to understand the util of our approach while remain the basic unit for applic of thi approach by extend thi model to triad we have shown how one mayb abl to model complic particl as connect togeth thi in away cor respond to the approach adapt by experi a list to fabric shape use d print where rod are connect togeth giri maj i and pope model homogen isotrop turbul hit tur bu len ce as a stochast veloc gradient use u hlen beck or nste in process the salient featur of thi model is that it captur the nonlinear term in the navier stoke equat respons for inerti effect exactli it use the tempor diffus equat of log normal pseudo dissip of chen and pope as a start point to develop a stochast differenti equat of veloc gra die nt tensor the model is then tune and constrain to match the pseudo dissip distribut and higher veloc gradient moment observ in the dn simul of y eung and pope as a result the model captur the correl observ in dn between the vortic and shear thi cou p ling of shear and vortic is import for success simul of or ien t ation dynam sinc the model captur onli the lead order effect of inertia it is im port ant to realiz that our simul area best represent of weak inertia re u and weak turbul g u and for sub kolmogorov particl howev we consid the entir spectrum of rel settl rate through the settl paramet s f settl paramet s f re g is the ratio of respons timescal to inertia sed and turbul the two im port ant contribut to orient

orient is by the turbul strongli and as are sul t the particl respond to the stochast veloc gradient rel quickli while follow a lagrangian trajectori thi result in anisotrop distribut of the particl orient as the particl settl veloc increas there is a larger of inertia lead to a horizont align of the thi appear as an asymptot decreas in the particl orient varianc in fig thi decreas in varianc ha a s f behaviour at rapid settl limit as expect from theori at thi regim the particl respond quickli to the inerti torqu resist deviat away from the horizont due to turbul howev for thi appear as a resist onli in the compon of orient and as a result the compon continu to respond to tur bu len ce timescal thi lead to a partial correl of particl orient and veloc gradient in our simul in our theori we assum the particl ori ent ation to complet de correl from the at the rapid settl limit for we add a factor of correl to our theoret asymptot as shown in eq to compar to simul in fig we have extend thi idea from to triad in section where we model the triad as three co planar constrain by rigid bodi dynam while thi is a rudimentari model that neglect ani arm to arm interact thi model captur the essenti featur and of the two import time scale involv by a settl paramet as the ratio of two timescal sed and like we did for we have simul the orient dist rib u tion of triad settl in turbul as shown in fig like in the case for the simul captur the sub kolmogorov dynam at weak inertia and weak turbul but for differ rel strength through s f we deter mine the timescal of respons to inertia sed as an invers rotat rate at by simul the rotat due to inertia torqu in a quiescent us ing the empir of s f we have a gener settl paramet that mayb use to compar orient dynam across particl and re in fig we compar our simul of and triad perform at re and we see that thi of s f help in identifi a univers power law relat of asymptot at the rapid settl limit it is commend that our simpl model is use in gener simul and theoret asymptot s that are valid across differ and particl paramet as shown in fig final we compar our simul and theori to the experiment result of kr amel in section as expect the experi are not restrict by the assumpt made in theori or simul the particl are no longer sub kolmogorov and there is more than just lead order effect captur how ever by ensur a similar de of s f is use we are abl to compar our simul to the experi in fig as can be seen our simul captur the trend and transit seen in experi well the differ in rapid settl asymptot coe f observ mayb attribut to the lim i tat ion and assumpt in our model for exampl the experi contain particl where the arm are not independ of each other ' we be li eve these arm interact and other higher order effect of inertia might be respons for thi differ to verifi these detail through simul one must perform dn of and triad it must be also remind that we have use a lagrangian model of turbul while thi mayb easili at the low settl limit s f we argu that at s f the particl respond to inertia quickli and as a result the frame of refer we choos for tur bu lent veloc gradient is inconsequenti howev as observ from our simul and theori comparison in fig a particl frame model of veloc gradient that involv the particl settl rate is necessari also at s f o these argument are no longer valid and one must use a particl frame model of turbul but it is import to note that our approach is still capabl of captur the trend observ in experi at all s f to conclud we would like to reiter that our model is a simpl descript of high aspect ratio particl captur the import contribut to their dynam due to turbul and inertia the model is valid for sub kolmogorov particl l settl under weak inertia and weak turbul we have howev through our simul and theori captur the salient fe a ture s of particl orient dynam and a settl paramet s f in the process that is use in understand the orient distribut of differ particl across
