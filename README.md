# Bardvja Recommendation System

Bardvja is a content based recommender system, created to identify open source peer-reviewed publications related to one's area of research. It was created primarily with the intention to identify research in fields outside one's primary area of study but that uses similar techniques and concepts. Science is the constant pursuit of knowledge and it is always beneficial to not re-invent the wheel. If there is a method or concept that is exploited well in another topic, Bardvja helps you identify such research. 

What makes Bardvja unique is that the only information you must supply to it is the path to your personal directory of papers, proposals, reports or other files of information in a PDF format. This was primarily inspired by the need to encourage open source papers and to democratize information. 

A major source of information used in this recommendation system is the open source ArXiv of Cornell University. In this current version, three subject queries are used to acquire information from the ArXiv.
