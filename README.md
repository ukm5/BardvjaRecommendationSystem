# Bardvja Recommendation System

Bardvja is a content based recommender system, created to identify open source peer-reviewed publications related to one's area of research. It was created to identify research in other subjects or areas that uses techniques and concepts similar to one's primary area of study. Science is a constant pursuit of knowledge and it is often beneficial to avoid re-inventing the wheel. If there is a method or concept that is exploited well in another topic, Bardvja helps you identify such research. It is our hope that Bardvja will help those excited to learn and apply their knowledge to a wide variety of topics.

What makes Bardvja unique is that the only information you must provide is the path to your personal directory of papers, proposals, reports or other files of information in a PDF format. This was primarily inspired by the need to encourage open source papers and to democratize information. 

A major source of information used in this recommendation system is the open source ArXiv of Cornell University. In this current version, three subject queries are used to acquire information from the ArXiv.

More algorithms and machine learning techniques maybe added to future versions to provide more insightful findings. Please feel free to use or modify the code, would much appreciate acknowledgment to Bardvja if it helped in your pursuit. You may reach me at ukm5@cornell.edu for suggestions/feedback that you may like to be included in the future versions. 

The name Bardvja was inspired from the ancient Vedic myth about the sage Bharadwaja who wished to gather all the knowledge in universe. It is told that he studied every second of his life and wished the Gods to let him continue his life for eons, in hopes of acquiring more wisdom.
