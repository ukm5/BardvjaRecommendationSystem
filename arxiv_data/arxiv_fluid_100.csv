"Metastability and nucleation in the dilute fluid phase of a simple model

possesses a fluid-fluid transition buried within the fluid-crystal coexistence
region, as do some globular proteins. If this fluid-fluid transition is not
buried deep inside the fluid-crystal coexistence region the crystalline phase
does not nucleate within the dilute fluid. We link this lack of nucleation of
the crystal to the interactions in our model and speculate that similar
interactions between globular proteins are responsible for the difficulty found
in crystallising many globular proteins.

Fluid dynamics and jamming in a dilatant fluid,http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.5063v1,"['Hiizu Nakanishi', 'Namiko Mitarai']","  We present a phenomenological fluid dynamics model for a dilatant fluid, i.e.
a severe shear thickening fluid, by introducing a state variable. The
Navier-Stokes equation is coupled with the state variable field, which evolves
in response to the local shear stress as the fluid is sheared. The viscosity is
assumed to depend upon the state variable and to diverge at a certain value due
to jamming. We demonstrate that the coupling of the fluid dynamics with the
shear thickening leads to an oscillatory instability in the shear flow. The
model also shows a peculiar response of the fluid to a strong external impact.

"The cost of swimming in generalized Newtonian fluids: Experiments with

through fluids with non-Newtonian rheology. Here, we use the model organism
Caenorhabditis elegans and tracking methods to experimentally investigate the
dynamics of undulatory swimming in shear-thinning fluids. Theory and simulation
have proposed that the cost of swimming, or mechanical power, should be lower
in a shear-thinning fluid compared to a Newtonian fluid of the same zero-shear
viscosity. We aim to provide an experimental investigation into the cost of
swimming in a shear-thinning fluid from (i) an estimate of the mechanical power
of the swimmer and (ii) the viscous dissipation rate of the flow field, which
should yield equivalent results for a self-propelled low Reynolds number
swimmer. We find the cost of swimming in shear-thinning fluids is less than or
equal to the cost of swimming in Newtonian fluids of the same zero-shear
viscosity; furthermore, the cost of swimming in shear-thinning fluids scales
with a fluid's effective viscosity and can be predicted using fluid rheology
and simple swimming kinematics. Our results agree reasonably well with previous
theoretical predictions and provide a framework for understanding the cost of
swimming in generalized Newtonian fluids.

Behavioural equivalences for fluid stochastic Petri nets,http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02641v1,"['Igor V. Tarasyuk', 'Peter Buchholz']","  We propose fluid equivalences to compare and reduce behaviour of labeled
fluid stochastic Petri nets (LFSPNs) while preserving their discrete and
continuous properties. We define a linear-time relation of fluid trace
equivalence and its branching-time counterpart, fluid bisimulation equivalence.
Both fluid relations take into account the essential features of the LFSPNs
behaviour: functional activity, stochastic timing and fluid flow. We consider
the LFSPNs whose continuous markings have no influence to the discrete ones and
whose discrete part is continuous time stochastic Petri nets. The underlying
stochastic model for the discrete part of the LFSPNs is continuous time Markov
chains (CTMCs). The performance analysis of the continuous part of LFSPNs is
accomplished via the associated stochastic fluid models (SFMs). We show that
fluid trace equivalence preserves average potential fluid change volume for the
transition sequences of every certain length. We prove that fluid bisimulation
equivalence preserves the aggregated probability functions: stationary
probability mass for the underlying CTMC, as well as stationary fluid buffer
empty probability, fluid density and distribution for the associated SFM.
Hence, the equivalence guarantees identity of a number of discrete and
continuous performance measures. Fluid bisimulation equivalence is then used to
simplify the qualitative and quantitative analysis of LFSPNs via quotienting
the discrete reachability graph and underlying CTMC. To describe the quotient
associated SFM, the quotients of the probability functions are defined. We
characterize logically fluid trace and bisimulation equivalences with two novel
fluid modal logics $HML_{flt}$ and $HML_{flb}$, based on the Hennessy-Milner
Logic HML. The application example of a document preparation system
demonstrates the behavioural analysis via quotienting by fluid bisimulation
equivalence.

Equivalence of Fluid Models for $G_t/GI/N+GI$ Queues,http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00346v2,"['Weining Kang', 'Guodong Pang']","  Four different fluid model formulations have been recently developed for

and Zhang's fluid model are not entirely equivalent under general initial
conditions. We then identify necessary and sufficient conditions under which

for the same system, in which certain measure-valued fluid processes tracking
residual service and patience times of each customer derived from Kang-Ramanan

magnetic fields on viscoelastic fluids. I show that it is possible to choose
electric or magnetic field gradient such that the effective acceleration due to
gravity is zero. If a heavy Newtonian fluid rests on top of a lighter Newtonian
fluid such a choice of field gradient would have rendered the arrangement
stable. If the fluids are viscoelastic, I show that a similar arrangement is

Lagrangian dynamics of incompressible thermofluids,http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.4823v1,"['Marco Tessarotto', 'Claudio Cremaschini', 'Piero Nicolini', 'Massimo Tessarotto']","  A key aspect of fluid dynamics is the correct definition of the \textit{%

the exact Lagrangian dynamics can be established based on the inverse kinetic

dynamics of these new stiff fluid spike solutions is qualitatively different
from that of the vacuum spike solutions, in that the matter (stiff fluid) feels
the spike directly and the stiff fluid spike solution can end up with a
permanent spike. We then derive the evolution equations of non-OT $G_2$ stiff

examined. As the fluid-fluid critical point is approached, the number of
molecules in the critical nucleus, the nucleus at the top of the free energy
barrier to nucleation, is found to diverge as the isothermal compressibility.
This divergence is due to a layer of the fluid phase of width equal to the
fluid's correlation length which surrounds the core of the nucleus; the number
of molecules in a crystalline environment in the nucleus does not diverge. The
free energy barrier to nucleation remains finite but its derivative with
respect to the chemical potential is equal to minus the number of molecules in
the critical nucleus and so diverges.

fluid pressure \textit{without solving the Poisson equation}% . In fact, the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations represent a mixture of hyperbolic and
elliptic pde's, which are extremely hard to study both analytically and
numerically. In this paper we intend to show that an exact solution to this
problem can be achieved adopting the approach based on inverse kinetic theory

consequence it is found that the fluid pressure obeys a well-defined evolution
equation. The result appears relevant for the construction of Lagrangian

interact among themselves. In this work we point out that the phase-space
Lagrangian description of incompressible Navier-Stokes fluids can be achieved
by means of a particular subset of ideal tracer particles, denoted as thermal
particles. For these particles the magnitude of their relative velocities -
with respect to the local fluid velocity - is solely determined by the kinetic
pressure, in turn, uniquely related to the fluid pressure. The dynamics of
thermal tracer particles is shown to generate the time-evolution of the fluid
fields by means of a suitable statistical model. The result is reached
introducing a 1-D statistical description of the fluid exclusively based on the
ensemble of thermal tracer particles. In particular, it is proven that the
statistic of thermal particles can be uniquely defined requiring that for these
particles the directions of their initial relative velocities are defined by a
suitable family of random coplanar unit vectors.

"The compressible viscous surface-internal wave problem: stability and
  vanishing surface tension limit",http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07579v1,"['Juhi Jang', 'Ian Tice', 'Yanjin Wang']","  This paper concerns the dynamics of two layers of compressible, barotropic,
viscous fluid lying atop one another. The lower fluid is bounded below by a
rigid bottom, and the upper fluid is bounded above by a trivial fluid of
constant pressure. This is a free boundary problem: the interfaces between the
fluids and above the upper fluid are free to move. The fluids are acted on by
gravity in the bulk, and at the free interfaces we consider both the case of
surface tension and the case of no surface forces. We establish a sharp
nonlinear global-in-time stability criterion and give the explicit decay rates
to the equilibrium. When the upper fluid is heavier than the lower fluid along
the equilibrium interface, we characterize the set of surface tension values in
which the equilibrium is nonlinearly stable. Remarkably, this set is non-empty,
i.e. sufficiently large surface tension can prevent the onset of the
Rayleigh-Taylor instability. When the lower fluid is heavier than the upper
fluid, we show that the equilibrium is stable for all non-negative surface
tensions and we establish the zero surface tension limit.

Stability Analysis of Non-Newtonian Rimming Flow,http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05102v1,"['Sergei Fomin', 'Ravi Shankar', 'Peter Haine']","  The rimming flow of a viscoelastic thin film inside a rotating horizontal
cylinder is studied theoretically. Attention is given to the onset of
non-Newtonian free-surface instability in creeping flow. This non-inertial
instability has been observed in experiments, but current theoretical models of
Newtonian fluids can neither describe its origin nor explain its onset. This
study examines two models of non Newtonian fluids to see if the experimentally
observed instability can be predicted analytically. The non-Newtonian viscosity
and elastic properties of the fluid are described by the Generalized Newtonian
Fluid (GNF) and Second Order Viscoelastic Fluid (SOVF) constitutive models,
respectively. With linear stability analysis, it is found that, analogously to
the Newtonian fluid, rimming flow of viscous non-Newtonian fluids (modeled by
GNF) is neutrally stable. However, the viscoelastic properties of the fluid
(modeled by SOVF) are found to contribute to the flow destabilization. The
instability is shown to increase as the cylinder rotation rate is lowered, from
which the fluid accumulates in a pool on the rising wall. Viscoelastic effects
coupled with this pooling cause the fluid's angular stretching, which is
suggested to be responsible for this onset of instability.

  Seven naturally occurring hydrocarbon fluids are known as petroleum fluids.
They include, in the order of their fluidity, natural gas, gas-condensate

this report we present a generalized description of the various phase
transitions, which may occur in petroleum fluids with emphasis on heavy

  At first the nature of every petroleum fluid is presented. Their constituents
including their socalled impurities are identified and categorized. Heavy
fractions in petroleum fluids are discussed and their main families of
constituents are presented including petroleum wax, diamondoids, asphaltenes
and petroleum resins. Then the generalized petroleum fluids phase behavior is
discussed in light of the known theory of phase transitions. The effects of
variations of composition, temperature and pressure on the phase behavior of
petroleum fluids are introduced. Finally eleven distinct phase-transition
points of petroleum fluids are presented and their relation with state
variables and constituents of petroleum fluids are identified. This report is

a comprehensive computational model for phase behavior prediction of all the

"Fluid-fluid versus fluid-solid demixing in mixtures of parallel hard
  hypercubes",http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.4930v2,"['Luis Lafuente', 'Yuri Martinez-Raton']","  It is well known that the increase of the spatial dimensionality enhances the
fluid-fluid demixing of a binary mixture of hard hyperspheres, i.e. the
demixing occurs for lower mixture size asymmetry as compared to the
three-dimensional case. However, according to simulations, in the latter
dimension the fluid-fluid demixing is metastable with respect to the
fluid-solid transition. According to the results obtained from approximations
to the equation of state of hard hyperspheres in higher dimensions, the
fluid-fluid demixing might becomes stable for high enough dimension. However,
this conclusion is rather speculative since none of the above works have taken
into account the stability of the crystalline phase (nor by a minimization of a
given density functional, neither spinodal calculations or MC simulations). Of
course, the lack of results is justified by the difficulty for performing
density functional calculations or simulations in high dimensions and, in
particular, for highly asymmetric binary mixtures. In the present work, we will
take advantage of a well tested theoretical tool, namely the fundamental
measure density functional theory for parallel hard hypercubes (in the
continuum and in the hypercubic lattice). With this, we have calculated the
fluid-fluid and fluid-solid spinodals for different spatial dimensions. We have
obtained, no matter of the dimensionality, the mixture size asymmetry nor the
polydispersity (included as a bimodal distribution function centered around the
asymmetric edge-lengths), that the fluid-fluid critical point is always located
above the fluid-solid spinodal. In conclusion, these results point to the
existence of demixing between at least one solid phase rich in large particles
and one fluid phase rich in small ones, preempting a fluid-fluid demixing,
independently of the spatial dimension or the polydispersity.

to the collisionless kinetic description than traditional magnetohydrodynamics.
Such fluid models are directly applicable to modeling turbulent evolution of a
vast array of astrophysical plasmas, such as the solar corona and the solar
wind, the interstellar medium, as well as accretion disks and galaxy clusters.
The text can be viewed as a detailed guide to Landau fluid models and it is
divided into two parts. Part 1 is dedicated to fluid models that are obtained
by closing the fluid hierarchy with simple (non Landau fluid) closures. Part 2
is dedicated to Landau fluid closures. Here in Part 1, we discuss the CGL fluid
model in great detail, together with fluid models that contain dispersive
effects introduced by the Hall term and by the finite Larmor radius (FLR)
corrections to the pressure tensor. We consider dispersive effects introduced
by the non-gyrotropic heat flux vectors. We investigate the parallel and
oblique firehose instability, and show that the non-gyrotropic heat flux
strongly influences the maximum growth rate of these instabilities.
Furthermore, we discuss fluid models that contain evolution equations for the
gyrotropic heat flux fluctuations and that are closed at the 4th-moment level
by prescribing a specific form for the distribution function. For the
bi-Maxwellian distribution, such a closure is known as the ""normal"" closure. We
also discuss a fluid closure for the bi-kappa distribution. Finally, by
considering one-dimensional Maxwellian fluid closures at higher-order moments,
we show that such fluid models are always unstable. The last possible non
Landau fluid closure is therefore the ""normal"" closure, and beyond the
4th-order moment, Landau fluid closures are required.

"Stability and onset of two-dimensional viscous fingering in immiscible
  fluids",http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02674v1,['Radha Ramachandran'],"  Viscous flows in a quasi-two-dimensional Hele-Shaw geometry can lead to an
interfacial instability when one fluid, of viscosity $\eta_{in}$ displaces
another of higher viscosity, $\eta_{out}$. Recent studies have shown that there
is a delay in the onset of fingering in miscible fluids as the viscosity ratio,
$\eta_{in}/\eta_{out}$, increases and approaches unity; the interface can
remain stable even though the displacing liquid is less viscous. This paper
shows that a delayed onset and stable pattern can occur in immiscible fluids as
well. However, there are two significant differences between the two cases.
First, in miscible fluids, stable patterns are obtained whenever
$\eta_{in}/\eta_{out} > 0.33$ while in immiscible fluids, the radius at which
the onset of fingering starts, $R_{onset}$, increases steadily until
$\eta_{in}/\eta_{out}=1$. A stable pattern is obtained only when the total size
of the plate used is smaller than $R_{onset}$. Second, once the delayed
fingering starts in immiscible fluids, the fingers grow faster than the central
circular region. In miscible fluids, there is a regime in which the fingers and
the central region grow in proportion to each other. These differences between
miscible and immiscible fingering are maintained even when we compare
immiscible fluids that have very low interfacial tension with miscible fluids
that have negligible diffusion.

solid. To date, 1D and 2D numerical models have been used predominantly to
study free surface flows. However, some phenomena have three-dimensional
behaviour such as the appearance of the limit between the liquid regime and the
solid regime. Here the aim is to use a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to
reproduce the properties of the free surface flow of yield stress fluids in an
open channel. Modelling the behaviour of the yield stress fluid is also
expected. The numerical study is driven with the software OpenFOAM. Numerical
outcomes are compared with experimental results from model experiment and
theorical predictions based on the rheological constitutive law. The 3D model
is validated by evaluating its capacity to reproduce reliably flow patterns.
The depth, the local velocity and the stress are quantified for different
numerical configurations (grid level, rheological parameters). Then numerical
results are used to detect the presence of rigid and sheared zones within the
flow.

A passive Stokes flow rectifier for Newtonian fluids,http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08296v1,"['Aryan Mehboudi', 'Junghoon Yeom']","  Non-linear effects of the Navier-Stokes equations disappear under the Stokes
regime of Newtonian fluid flows disallowing the fluid flow rectification. Here
we show mathematically and experimentally that passive flow rectification of
Newtonian fluids is obtainable under the Stokes regime of both compressible and
incompressible flows by introducing nonlinearity into the otherwise linear
Stokes equations. Asymmetric flow resistances arise in shallow nozzle/diffuser
microchannels with deformable ceiling, in which the fluid flow is governed by a
non-linear coupled fluid-solid mechanics equation. Fluid flow rectification has
been demonstrated for low-Reynolds-number flows (Re ~ O(0.001)-O(1)) of common
Newtonian fluids such as air, water, and alcohol. This mechanism can pave the
way for regulating the low-Reynolds-number fluid flows with potential
applications in precise low-flow-rate micropumps, drug delivery systems, etc.

The effect of Maxwellian fluid on wave propagation in porous media,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10495v2,"['Weitao Sun', 'Fansheng Xiong']","  This study investigates the effect of a Maxwellian fluid on the propagation
of waves in poroelastic media. Based on a fractional derivative stress-strain
relation, a viscous dissipation function is obtained to measure the
viscoelastic fluid-solid coupling effect. With the viscous dissipation
function, elastic waves propagation is formulated in poroelastic media
saturated by a fractional derivative Maxwellian fluid, and the analytical
expression of the P- and S-wave dispersion/attenuation is presented. Numerical
examples show that the fractional derivative Maxwell strain-stress relation has
a significant influence on wave velocities and causes the fluid-solid coupling
transition from a dissipative regime to an elastic regime. In addition, the
predicted fluid velocities are consistent with the laboratory observations of
viscoelastic fluids under an oscillating pressure gradient. The results
indicate that a viscous-elastic fluid effect may account for the velocity
oscillation observed in laboratory. The method elucidates dynamical differences
for viscous and viscoelastic fluid in porous medium, which may be of great
importance to unconventional oil/gas exploration industry as well as
theoretical researches.

CFT dual of the AdS Dirichlet problem: Fluid/Gravity on cut-off surfaces,http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.2577v2,"['Daniel K. Brattan', 'Joan Camps', 'R. Loganayagam', 'Mukund Rangamani']","  We study the gravitational Dirichlet problem in AdS spacetimes with a view to
understanding the boundary CFT interpretation. We define the problem as bulk
Einstein's equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions on fixed timelike
cut-off hypersurface. Using the fluid/gravity correspondence, we argue that one
can determine non-linear solutions to this problem in the long wavelength
regime. On the boundary we find a conformal fluid with Dirichlet constitutive
relations, viz., the fluid propagates on a `dynamical' background metric which
depends on the local fluid velocities and temperature. This boundary fluid can
be re-expressed as an emergent hypersurface fluid which is non-conformal but
has the same value of the shear viscosity as the boundary fluid. The
hypersurface dynamics arises as a collective effect, wherein effects of the
background are transmuted into the fluid degrees of freedom. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that this collective fluid is forced to be non-relativistic below a
critical cut-off radius in AdS to avoid acausal sound propagation with respect
to the hypersurface metric. We further go on to show how one can use this
set-up to embed the recent constructions of flat spacetime duals to
non-relativistic fluid dynamics into the AdS/CFT correspondence, arguing that a
version of the membrane paradigm arises naturally when the boundary fluid lives
on a background Galilean manifold.

Waving transport and propulsion in a generalized Newtonian fluid,http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4260v1,"['J. Rodrigo VÃ©lez-Cordero', 'Eric Lauga']","  Cilia and flagella are hair-like appendages that protrude from the surface of
a variety of eukaryotic cells and deform in a wavelike fashion to transport
fluids and propel cells. Motivated by the ubiquity of non-Newtonian fluids in
biology, we address mathematically the role of shear-dependent viscosities on
both the waving flagellar locomotion and ciliary transport by metachronal
waves. Using a two-dimensional waving sheet as model for the kinematics of a
flagellum or an array of cilia, and allowing for both normal and tangential
deformation of the sheet, we calculate the flow field induced by a
small-amplitude deformation of the sheet in a generalized Newtonian Carreau
fluid up to order four in the dimensionless waving amplitude. Shear-thinning
and shear-thickening fluids are seen to always induce opposite effects. When
the fluid is shear-thinning, the rate of working of the sheet against the fluid
is always smaller than in the Newtonian fluid, and the largest gain is obtained
for antiplectic metachronal waves. Considering a variety of deformation
kinematics for the sheet, we further show that in all cases transport by the
sheet is more efficiency in a shear-thinning fluid, and in most cases the
transport speed in the fluid is also increased. Comparing the order of
magnitude of the shear-thinning contributions with past work on elastic effects
as well as the magnitude of the Newtonian contributions, our theoretical
results suggest that the impact of shear-dependent viscosities on transport
could play a major biological role.

electromagnetic response in the superconducting states. Both superfluid and
normal-fluid dynamics are involved. We predict that the normal fluid is present
only when the excited superconducting velocity $v_s$ is larger than a threshold
$v_L=|\Delta|/k_F$. Interestingly, with the normal fluid, we find that there
exists friction between the normal-fluid and superfluid currents. Due to this
friction, part of the superfluid becomes viscous. Therefore, a three-fluid
model: normal fluid, non-viscous and viscous superfluids, is proposed. For the
stationary magnetic response, at $v_s<v_L$ with only the non-viscous
superfluid, the Meissner supercurrent is excited and the gap equation can
reduce to Ginzburg-Landau equation. At $v_s{\ge}v_L$, with the normal fluid,
non-viscous and viscous superfluids, in addition to the directly excited
Meissner supercurrent in the superfluid, normal-fluid current is also induced
through the friction drag with the viscous superfluid current. Due to the
normal-fluid and viscous superfluid currents, the penetration depth is
influenced by the scattering effect. In addition, a modified Ginzburg-Landau
equation is proposed. We predict an exotic phase in which both the resistivity
and superconducting gap are {\em finite}. As for the optical response, the
excited ${v_s}$ oscillates with time. When $v_s<v_L$, only the non-viscous
superfluid is present whereas at $v_s{\ge}v_L$, normal fluid, non-viscous and
viscous superfluids are present. We show that the excited normal-fluid current
exhibits the Drude-model behavior while the superfluid current consists of the
Meissner supercurrent and Bogoliubov quasiparticle current. Due to the friction
between the superfluid and normal-fluid currents, the optical conductivity is
captured by the three-fluid model. ......

For the case of a strongly polar fluid like pure water, an electric potential

viscoelastic stresses. Relevant examples include the ciliary transport of
respiratory airway mucus and the motion of spermatozoa in the mucus-filled
female reproductive tract. We consider the simplest model of such propulsion
and transport in a complex fluid, a waving sheet of small amplitude free to
move in a polymeric fluid with a single relaxation time. We show that, compared
to self-propulsion in a Newtonian fluid occurring at a velocity U_N, the sheet
swims (or transports fluid) with velocity U / U_N = [1+De^2 (eta_s)/(eta)
]/[1+De^2], where eta_s is the viscosity of the Newtonian solvent, eta is the
zero-shear-rate viscosity of the polymeric fluid, and De is the Deborah number
for the wave motion, product of the wave frequency by the fluid relaxation
time. Similar expressions are derived for the rate of work of the sheet and the
mechanical efficiency of the motion. These results are shown to be independent
of the particular nonlinear constitutive equations chosen for the fluid, and
are valid for both waves of tangential and normal motion. The generalization to
more than one relaxation time is also provided. In stark contrast with the
Newtonian case, these calculations suggest that transport and locomotion in a
non-Newtonian fluid can be conveniently tuned without having to modify the
waving gait of the sheet but instead by passively modulating the material
properties of the liquid.

a locally varying slip distribution along the fluid-fluid interface, which
models the effect of the secondary fluid on the outer flow. The obtained

of the primary fluid explicitly contain the influence of the viscosities of the

the surface geometry. They agree well with results from numerical computations

influence of the viscous stresses inside the secondary fluid for arbitrary

Simulating the Dynamic Behavior of Shear Thickening Fluids,http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.09069v1,"['Oktar Ozgen', 'Marcelo Kallmann', 'Eric Brown']","  While significant research has been dedicated to the simulation of fluids,
not much attention has been given to exploring new interesting behavior that
can be generated with the different types of non-Newtonian fluids with
non-constant viscosity. Going in this direction, this paper introduces a
computational model for simulating the interesting phenomena observed in
non-Newtonian shear thickening fluids, which are fluids where the viscosity
increases with increased stress. These fluids have unique and unconventional
behavior, and they often appear in real world scenarios such as when sinking in
quicksand or when experimenting with popular cornstarch and water mixtures.
While interesting behavior of shear thickening fluids can be easily observed in
the real world, the most interesting phenomena of these fluids have not been
simulated before in computer graphics. The fluid exhibits unique phase changes
between solid and liquid states, great impact resistance in its solid state and
strong hysteresis effects. Our proposed approach builds on existing
non-Newtonian fluid models in computer graphics and introduces an efficient
history-based stiffness term that is essential to produce the most interesting
shear thickening phenomena. The history-based stiffness is formulated through
the use of fractional derivatives, leveraging the fractional calculus ability
to depict both the viscoelastic behavior and the history effects of
history-dependent systems. Simulations produced by our method are compared
against real experiments and the results demonstrate that the proposed model
successfully captures key phenomena observed in shear thickening fluids.

collective behavior that depends critically on fluid opacity, mechanism of
self-propulsion, and type of particle-particle interaction. In ""clear fluids""
swimmers have full knowledge of their surroundings and can adjust their
velocities with respect to the lab frame, while in ""opaque fluids,"" they
control their velocities only in relation to the local fluid flow. We also show
that ""social"" interactions that affect only a particle's propensity to swim
towards or away from neighbors induces a flow field that is qualitatively
different from the long-ranged flow fields generated by direct ""physical""
interactions. The latter can be short-ranged but lead to much longer-ranged
fluid-mediated hydrodynamic forces, effectively amplifying the range over which
particles interact. These different fluid flows conspire to profoundly affect
swarm morphology, kinetically stabilizing or destabilizing swarm configurations
that would arise in the absence of fluid. Depending upon the overall
interaction potential, the mechanism of swimming (e.g., pushers or pullers),
and the degree of fluid opaqueness, we discover a number of new collective
three-dimensional patterns including flocks with prolate or oblate shapes,
recirculating peloton-like structures, and jet-like fluid flows that entrain
particles mediating their escape from the center of mill-like structures. Our
results reveal how the interplay among general physical elements influence

\textit{et al}., 2018 J. Phys. Condens. Matter \textbf{30} 345101], we
linearized the Stokes-Oldroyd B fluid model and thereby explicitly formulated
the frequency dependent moduli in terms of ($\mu_p$) and ($\mu_s$), which we
now extend to account for an external sinusoidal force applied to the probe
particle. We measure $\lambda$, $\mu_p$, and $\mu_s$ experimentally, and
compare with existing the $\lambda$ values in the literature for the same fluid
at some of the dilution levels, and obtain good agreement. Further, we use
these parameters to calculate the complex elastic modulus of the fluid again at
certain dilutions and verify successfully with existing data. This establishes
our method as an alternate approach in the active microrheology of complex
fluids which should reveal information about the composition of such fluids in
significantly greater detail and high signal to noise.

Viscous-elastic dynamics of power-law fluids within an elastic cylinder,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02390v1,"['Evgeniy Boyko', 'Moran Bercovici', 'Amir D. Gat']","  In a wide range of applications, microfluidic channels are implemented in
soft substrates. In such configurations, where fluidic inertia and
compressibility are negligible, the propagation of fluids in channels is
governed by a balance between fluid viscosity and elasticity of the surrounding
solid. The viscous-elastic interactions between elastic substrates and
non-Newtonian fluids are particularly of interest due to the dependence of
viscosity on the state of the system. In this work, we study the
fluid-structure interaction dynamics between an incompressible non-Newtonian
fluid and a slender linearly elastic cylinder under the creeping flow regime.
Considering power-law fluids and applying the thin shell approximation for the
elastic cylinder, we obtain a non-homogeneous p-Laplacian equation governing
the viscous-elastic dynamics. We present exact solutions for the pressure and
deformation fields for various initial and boundary conditions for both
shear-thinning and shear-thickening fluids. We show that in contrast to Stokes'
problem where a compactly supported front is obtained for shear-thickening
fluids, here the role of viscosity is inversed and such fronts are obtained for
shear-thinning fluids. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for the case of a step
in inlet pressure, the propagation rate of the front has a $t^{\frac{n}{n+1}}$
dependence on time ($t$), suggesting the ability to indirectly measure the
power-law index ($n$) of shear-thinning liquids through measurements of elastic
deformation.

  microtubules",http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11675v1,"['Teagan E. Bate', 'Edward J. Jarvis', 'Megan E. Varney', 'Kun-Ta Wu']","  Self-organization of kinesin-driven, microtubule-based 3D active fluids
relies on the collective dynamics of single microtubules. However, the
connection between macroscopic fluid flows and microscopic motion of
microtubules remains unclear. In this work, the motion of single microtubules
was characterized by means of 2D gliding assays and compared with the flows of
3D active fluids. While the scales of the two systems differ by 1,000x, both
were driven by processive, non-processive or an equal mixture of both molecular
motor proteins. To search for the dynamic correlation between both systems, the
motor activities were tuned by varying temperature and ATP concentration, and
the changes in both systems were compared. Motor processivity played an
important role in active fluid flows but only when the fluids were nearly
motionless; otherwise, flows were dominated by hydrodynamic resistance
controlled by sample size. Furthermore, while the motors' thermal reaction led
active fluids to flow faster with increasing temperature, such temperature
dependence could be reversed by introducing temperature-varying depletants,
emphasizing the potential role of the depletant in designing an active fluid's
temperature response. The temperature response of active fluids was nearly
immediate (<10 sec). Such a characteristic enables active fluids to be
controlled with a temperature switch. Overall, this work not only clarifies the
role of temperature in active fluid activity, but also sheds light on the
underlying principles of the relationship between the collective dynamics of
active fluids and the dynamics of their constituent single microtubules.

interesting, invariant subspace and find all equilibrium points that are future

dynamically insignificant at late times. For the value $\gamma=6/5$ there is a
2-dimensional bifurcation set, and if both fluids are stiffer than $\gamma=6/5$
both fluids will have extreme tilt asymptotically. We investigate the case in

be frozen into the fluid, and the Kelvin's theorem on the velocity circulation

After reduction by the diffeomorphism group we obtain the fluid-structure

finish by introducing viscosity in our framework as an external force and

Multiscale modelling couples patches of two-layer thin fluid flow,http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7093v1,"['Meng Cao', 'A. J. Roberts']","  The multiscale gap-tooth scheme uses a given microscale simulator of
complicated physical processes to enable macroscale simulations by computing
only only small sparse patches. This article develops the gap-tooth scheme to
the case of nonlinear microscale simulations of thin fluid flow. The microscale
simulator is derived by artificially assuming the fluid film flow having two
artificial layers but no distinguishing physical feature. Centre manifold
theory assures that there exists a slow manifold in the two-layer fluid film
flow. Eigenvalue analysis confirms the stability of the microscale simulator.
This article uses the gap-tooth scheme to simulate the two-layer fluid film
flow. Coupling conditions are developed by approximating the values at the
edges of patches by neighbouring macroscale values. Numerical eigenvalue
analysis suggests that the gap-tooth scheme with the developed two-layer
microscale simulator empowers feasible computation of large scale simulations
of fluid film flows. We also implement numerical simulations of the fluid film
flow by the gap-tooth scheme. Comparison between a gap-tooth simulation and a
microscale simulation over the whole domain demonstrates that the gap-tooth

Scales of a fluid,http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.8237v1,['Billy D. Jones'],"  The flow of a viscous fluid is perturbed by its internal friction which
generates heat and leads to a small temperature change. This does not occur for
an ideal fluid. We would like to resolve this picture as a function of the
dynamical macroscopic scales of both problems. In order to do this we will
study the evolution of the Navier-Stokes Hamiltonian with the classical
similarity renormalization group in the region of small viscosity. The
connection between the Euler and Navier-Stokes fluids will be pursued, but also
the viscous structures that arise will be studied in their own right to
determine the low-order velocity correlators of realistic fluids such as
single-component air and water. The canonical coordinate of the Navier-Stokes
Hamiltonian is a vector field that stores the initial position of all the fluid
particles. Thus these appear to be natural coordinates for studying arbitrary
separations of fluid particles over time. This connection will be pursued and
the region where the classic 1926 Richardson 4/3 scaling law holds will be
determined. The evolution of the Euler Hamiltonian will also be studied and we
will attempt to map its singular structures to those of the small-viscosity
Navier-Stokes fluid.

which a spherical elastic shell or membrane is immersed in a 3D viscous,

formulated mathematically using the immersed boundary framework in which Dirac
delta functions are employed to capture the two-way interaction between fluid

time-periodic modulation of the elastic membrane stiffness. We perform a
Floquet stability analysis, considering the case of both a viscous and inviscid
fluid, and demonstrate that the forced fluid-membrane system gives rise to
parametric resonances in which the solution becomes unbounded even in the
presence of viscosity. The analytical results are validated using numerical
simulations with a 3D immersed boundary code for a range of wavenumbers and
physical parameter values. Finally, potential applications to biological

Existence of the passage to the limit of inviscid fluid,http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01458v2,['Denis S. Goldobin'],"  In the dynamics of viscous fluid, the case of vanishing kinematic viscosity
is actually equivalent to the Reynolds number tending to infinity. Hence, in
the limit of vanishing viscosity the fluid flow is essentially turbulent. On
the other hand, the Euler equation, which is conventionally adopted for
description of flow of inviscid fluid, does not possess proper turbulent
behaviour. This raises the question of the existence of the passage to the
limit of inviscid fluid for real low-viscosity fluids. To address this
question, one should employ the theory of turbulent boundary layer near an
inflexible boundary (e.g., rigid wall). On the basis of this theory, one can
see how the solutions to the Euler equation become relevant for the description
of flow of low-viscosity fluids, and obtain the small parameter quantifying
accuracy of this description for real fluids.

understanding how active colloids move and interact in Newtonian fluids, little
is known on how active colloids behave in complex and non-Newtonian fluids. An
emerging literature is starting to show how fluid rheology can dramatically
change the gaits and speeds of individual swimmers. Simultaneously, a moving
swimmer induces time dependent, three dimensional fluid flows, that can modify
the medium (fluid) rheological properties. This two-way, non-linear coupling at

characteristics. With our method, we achieve explicit control over both
large-scale motions and small-scale details which is valuable for many

simulation), spatially varying guiding strength, domain modification, and
resimulation with different fluid parameters. For the separating solid-wall

Similarly to swimming in a Newtonian fluid, we obtain for each fluid a

The fluid is seen to always increase the swimming speed of the helix, up to 50%
faster and thus the strongest of such type reported to date. The maximum
relative increase for a fluid power index of around 0.6. Using simple scalings,
we argue that the speed increase is not due to the local decrease of the flow
viscosity around the helical filament but hypothesise instead that it
originates from confinement-like effect due to viscosity stratification around

Inertial flow around obstacles in microchannels,http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03893v1,['Hamed Haddadi'],"  Formation of recirculating wakes is a prominent feature of inertial flow
around bluff bodies. Below the onset of vortex shedding in uniform unbounded
flows, the fluid in the recirculating wake region moves on closed planar
orbits. The steady wake is thus an isolated zone in the flow and does not
exchange fluid with the free stream. In this work, we utilize lattice-Boltzmann
simulations and microfluidic experiments to demonstrate that in microchannel
inertial flow of Newtonian fluids, the recirculating wake is replaced by a
three-dimensional vortical flow. Spiraling streamlines generate a continuous
exchange of fluid between the vortex behind the obstacle and the free stream.
The flow inertia is represented by Reynolds number defined as $Re =
\frac{u_{max}D_{y}}{\nu}$, where $u_{max}$ is the maximum fluid velocity in the
channel inlet, $D_{y}$ is the characteristic obstacle length and $\nu$ is the
fluid kinematic viscosity. We discuss the effects of $Re$, the obstacle shape
and the wall confinement on the fluid entry into the vortex. Further, we
demonstrate that in flow of a dilute suspension of particles around the

reduces the fluid-fluid interfacial area and the trapping of the defending

can be described by local conservation laws supplemented with local
constitutive equations satisfying Onsager's reciprocal relations (ORR). We

Lorentz reciprocal theorem (GLRT) and global Onsager's reciprocal relations

between ORR for local constitutive equations and GORR for constitutive
equations at boundaries. Finally, we show that the LRT can be further extended
to non-isothermal systems by considering as an example the thermal conduction

another functional: the disorder-averaged free energy plus the fluid-matrix

regarded as depending on the density profile of the matrix fluid as well. In
this situation, the replica-Ornstein-Zernike equations which do not contain the

Symmetry Breaking using Fluids II: Velocity Potential Method,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9904079v1,['Mark D. Roberts'],"  A generalization of scalar electrodynamics called fluid electrodynamics is
presented. In this theory a fluid replaces the Higgs scalar field. Fluid
electrodynamics might have application to the theory of low temperature Helium
superfluids, but here it is argued that it provides an alternative method of
approaching symmetry breaking in particle physics. The method of constructing
fluid electrodynamics is to start with the velocity decomposition of a perfect
fluid as in general relativity. A unit vector tangent to the flow lines of an
isentropic fluid can be written in terms of scalar potentials:
$V_a=h^{-1}(\ph_a+\al\bt_a-\th S)$. A novel interacting charged fluid can be
obtained by applying the covariant derivative: $D_a=\p_a+ieA_a$ to these scalar
potentials. This fluid is no longer isentropic and there are choices for which
it either obeys the second law of thermodynamics or not. A mass term of the
correct sign occurs for the $A$ term in the stress, and this mass term depends
on the potentials in the above vector. The charged fluid can be reduced to
scalar electrodynamics and the standard approach to symmetry breaking applied;
alternatively a mass can be induced by the fluid by using just the
thermodynamic potentials and then fixing at a critical point, if this is taken
to be the Bose condensation point then the induced mass is negligible.

for simplest case of homogeneous medium. Frequencies and damping rates of waves
are obtained for different parameters of background plasma. We found that two-
and single-fluid descriptions give similar results for low frequency waves.
However, the dynamics of MHD waves in two-fluid approach is significantly
changed when the wave frequency becomes comparable or higher than ion-neutral

maximum damping rate at particular frequencies (for example, the peak frequency
equals 2.5 ion-neutral collision frequency for 50 % of neutral Hydrogen) in

new mode of slow magneto-acoustic wave appears for higher frequency branch,
which is connected to neutral hydrogen fluid. The single-fluid approach
perfectly deals with slow processes in partially ionized plasmas, but fails for
time-scales smaller than ion-neutral collision time. Therefore, two-fluid

On equivalence of thinning fluids used for hydraulic fracturing,http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.1847v1,['Alexander Linkov'],"  The paper aims to answer the question: if and how non-Newtonian fluids may be
compared in their mechanical action when used for hydraulic fracturing? By
employing the modified formulation of the PKN problem we obtain its simple
analytical solutions in the cases of perfectly plastic and Newtonian fluids.
Since the results for shear thinning fluids are intermediate between those for
these cases, the obtained equation for the fracture length suggests a criterion
of the equivalence of various shear thinning fluids for the problem of
hydraulic fractures. We assume fluids equivalent in their hydrofracturing
action, when at a reference time they produce fractures of the same length. The
equation for the fracture length translates the equivalence in terms of the
hydraulic fracture length and treatment time into the equivalence in terms of
the properties of a fracturing fluid (behavior and consistency indices).
Analysis shows that the influence of the consistency and behavior indices on
the fracture length, particle velocity and propagation speed is quite similar
when considering the PKN and KGD models despite the models refer to different
plain-strain states. It appears that from the mechanical point of view, the
differences between thinning fluids are not significant; they may be taken into
account when wishing to have some quantity to be greater (less) at small
(large) time. We conclude that a choice of a fracturing fluid is to be made
mostly from technological and/or economic considerations under the condition
that the compared fluids are equivalent in their mechanical effect according to
the suggested criterion.

promising prospects as artificial microswimmers. However, their swimming
behavior and its dependence on fluid properties and fluid-colloid interactions
remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the behavior of a thermophoretic
Janus colloid in its own temperature gradient using numerical simulations. The
dissipative particle dynamics method with energy conservation is used to
investigate the behavior in non-ideal and ideal-gas like fluids for different
fluid-colloid interactions, boundary conditions, and temperature-controlling
strategies. The fluid-colloid interactions appear to have a strong effect on
the colloid behavior, since they directly affect heat exchange between the
colloid surface and the fluid. The simulation results show that a reduction of
the heat exchange at the fluid-colloid interface leads to an enhancement of
colloid's thermophoretic mobility. The colloid behavior is found to be
different in non-ideal and ideal fluids, suggesting that fluid compressibility
plays a significant role. The flow field around the colloid surface is found to
be dominated by a source-dipole, in agreement with the recent theoretical and
simulation predictions. Finally, different temperature-control strategies do
not appear to have a strong effect on the colloid's swimming velocity.

self-propel in viscous fluids. While appropriate theoretical modelling is
available to capture flagella locomotion in simple, Newtonian fluids,
formidable computations are required to address theoretically their locomotion

for the motion of rigid rods in non-Newtonian fluids and on the classical
Carreau fluid model, we propose empirical extensions of the classical Newtonian
resistive-force theory to model the waving of slender filaments in
non-Newtonian fluids. By assuming the flow near the flagellum to be locally
Newtonian, we propose a self-consistent way to estimate the typical shear-rate
in the fluid, which we then use to construct correction factors to the
Newtonian local drag coefficients. The resulting non-Newtonian resistive-force
theory, while empirical, is consistent with the Newtonian limit, and with the
experiments. We then use our models to address waving locomotion in
non-Newtonian fluids, and show that the resulting swimming speeds are
systematically lowered -- a result which we are able to capture asymptotically
and to interpret physically. An application of the models to recent
experimental results on the locomotion of Caenorhabditis elegans in polymeric
solutions shows reasonable agreement and thus captures the main physics of
swimming in shear-thinning fluids.

A Ball Breaking Away from a Fluid,http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04310v1,"['B. Turnbull', 'M. M. Scase', 'D. S. Percival']","  We consider the withdrawal of a ball from a fluid reservoir to understand the
longevity of the connection between that ball and the fluid it breaks away
from, at intermediate Reynolds numbers. Scaling arguments based on the
processes observed as the ball interacts with the fluid surface were applied to
the `pinch-off time', when the ball breaks its connection with the fluid from
which it has been withdrawn, measured experimentally. At the lowest Reynolds
numbers tested, pinch-off occurs in a `surface seal' close to the reservoir
surface, where at larger Reynolds numbers pinch-off occurs in an `ejecta seal'
close to the ball. Our scaling analysis shows that the connection between ball
and fluid is controlled by the fluid film draining from the ball as it
continues to be winched away from the fluid reservoir. The draining flow itself
depends on the amount of fluid coating the ball on exit from the reservoir. We
consider the possibilities that this coating was created through: a surface
tension driven Landau Levitch Derjaguin wetting of the surface; a
visco-inertial quick coating; or alternatively through the inertia of the fluid
moving with the ball through the reservoir. We show that although the pinch-off
mechanism is controlled by viscosity, the coating mechanism is governed by a
different length and timescale, dictated by the inertial added mass of the ball
when submersed.

phases, which may have high density and viscosity ratios, is evolved by solving
the conservative phase-field Allen-Cahn equation in the arbitrary
Lagrangian-Eulerian coordinates. While the Navier-Stokes equations are solved
by a stabilized Petrov-Galerkin method, the conservative Allen-Chan phase-field

There are, however, at least two obstructions to the generalization of such
methods to Oldroyd-B fluids. One previously recognized problem is the fact that
the natural energy does not correspond to a proper functional norm on
perturbations. Another problem, original to this work, is the fact that
fluctuations in Oldroyd-B fluids may be subject to non-normal amplification at
arbitrarily low Reynolds numbers (albeit at sufficiently large Weissenberg
numbers). Such transient growth, occuring even when the base flow is linearly

Rodless Weissenberg effect,http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.1551v1,"['Enrique Soto', 'Oscar R. EnrÃ­quez', 'Roberto Zenit', 'Octavio Manero']","  The climbing effect of a viscoelastic fluid when stirred by a spinning rod is
well documented and known as Weissenberg effect(Wei et al, 2006). This
phenomenon is related to the elasticity of the fluid. We have observed that
this effect can appear when the fluid is stirred without a rod. In this work, a
comparison of the flow around a spinning disk for a Newtonian and a
non-Newtonian liquids is presented. The flow is visualized with ink and small
bubbles as fluid path tracers. For a Newtonian fluid, at the center of the
spinning disk, the fluid velocity is directed towards the disk (sink flow); on
the other hand, for a viscoelatic liquid, a source flow is observed since the
fluid emerges from the disk. The toroidal vortices that appear on top of the
disk rotate in opposite directions for the Newtonian and non-Newtonian cases.
Similar observations have been reported for the classical rod climbing flow
(Siginer, 1984 and Escudier, 1984). Some authors have suggested that this flow
configuration can be used to determine the elastic properties of the liquid
(Escuider, 1984 and Joshep, 1973).

Two non-comoving stiff fluids in radial motion and spherical symmetry,http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.0578v1,['Valentin Kostov'],"  The problem of two stiff fluids (energy density = pressure) moving radially
in spherical symmetry is treated. The metric ansatz is chosen spherically
symmetric, conformally static with a multiplicative separation of variables.
The first fluid is described mathematically via a massless scalar field. The
coordinate system is chosen comoving with the second fluid which the separation
of variables requires to be stiff too. The fluids are interacting only
gravitationally and their energy momentum tensors are separately conserved. The
Einstein equations are reduced to a single nonlinear ODE of second order which
is shown to lead to an Abel ODE. A few particular exact solutions were found
using a polynomial ansatz. The two non-comoving gravitational sources in the
solutions can be interpreted either as scalar fields or stiff fluids. A
complete analysis is performed on the range of parameters for which the stiff
fluid interpretation is physically acceptable. General formulas are derived for
the conformal vectors of the solutions. By making the second fluid vanish, a
few single scalar field solutions are generated some of which appear to be new.
All solutions considered in this paper have a time-like singularity at the
origin (except the trivial FRW one) and are not asymptotically flat (except the
static one with k=0).

Two-dimensional flagellar synchronization in viscoelastic fluids,http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2377v1,"['Gwynn J. Elfring', 'On Shun Pak', 'Eric Lauga']","  Experimental studies have demonstrated that spermatozoa synchronize their
flagella when swimming in close proximity. In a Newtonian fluid, it was shown
theoretically that such synchronization arises passively due to hydrodynamic
forces between the two swimmers if their waveforms exhibit a front-back
geometrical asymmetry. Motivated by the fact that most biological fluids
possess a polymeric microstructure, we address here synchronization in a
viscoelastic fluid analytically. Using a two-dimensional infinite sheet model
we show that the presence of polymeric stresses removes the geometrical
asymmetry constraint, and therefore even symmetric swimmers synchronize. Such
synchronization occurs on asymptotically faster time scales than in a Newtonian
fluid, and the swimmers are seen to be driven into a stable in-phase
conformation minimizing the energy dissipated in the surrounding fluid.

swimmer is the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which is an undulating

a highly periodic swimming behavior as the fluid viscosity is varied from 1.0
mPa-s to 12 mPa-s. Surprisingly, the nematode's swimming speed (~0.35 mm/s) is
nearly insensitive to the range of fluid viscosities investigated here.
However, the nematode's beating frequency decreases to an asymptotic value
(~1.7 Hz) with increasing fluid viscosity. A simple model is used to estimate
the nematode's Young's modulus and tissue viscosity. Both material properties
increase with increasing fluid viscosity. It is proposed that the increase in
Young's modulus may be associated with muscle contraction in response to larger

of viscous momentum between the wall and the main stream, following the classic
visualisation of inrush-sweep-ejection/burst. The thickness of the wall layer
is found to be the same for Newtonian and purely viscous non-Newtonian fluids,
when normalised with the instantaneous wall parameters at the onset of
bursting. The results indicate that the mechanisms of turbulence in Newtonian

in turbulence are based on phase-locked parameters linked with the development
of secondary flows rather than on time-averaged wall parameters. This
similarity analysis collapses the local critical instantaneous friction factor
data of both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids at the point of bursting into a

a constant pressure gradient in an infinite long straight pipe. By employing
the method of variable separations and Heaviside operational calculus, we
obtain the exact solution, from which the flow characteristics are
investigated. It is found that the start-up motion of fractional Maxwell's
fluid with parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, tends to be at rest as time goes to
infinity, except the case of $\beta=1$. This observation, which also can be
predicted from the mechanics analogue of fractional Maxwell's model, agrees
with the classical work of Friedrich and it indicates fractional Maxwell's
fluid presents solid-like behavior if $\be\neq 1$ and fluid-like behavior if
$\be=1$. For an arbitrary viscoelastic model, a conjecture is proposed to give
an intuitive way judging whether it presents fluid-like or solid-like behavior.

conversely, reducing the radiation strength. The overall effectiveness and the

  correspondences",http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0753v3,"['Yoshinori Matsuo', 'Yuya Sasai']","  Correspondences between black holes and fluids have been discussed in two
different frameworks, the Fluid/Gravity correspondence and membrane paradigm.
Recently, it has been discussed that these two theories can be understood as
the same theory if the cutoff surface is placed slightly outside the horizon.
The bulk viscosity is different for these two theories, but it does not
contribute to physics since the fluid becomes incompressible in the near
horizon limit. In the AdS/CFT correspondence, it is known that the fluid
becomes compressible and the bulk viscosity is zero, apart from the near
horizon limit. In this paper, we consider the Fluid/Gravity correspondence in
asymptotically non-AdS geometries. We put the cutoff surface near but at a
finite distance from the horizon. Then, the model becomes the membrane paradigm
with compressible fluid. We show that the bulk viscosity is not negative at
least within the linear response regime. We also discuss the higher derivative
corrections in the stress-energy tensor.

Mixing and transport by ciliary carpets: a numerical study,http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.2511v1,"['Yang Ding', 'Janna Nawroth', 'Margaret McFall-Ngai', 'Eva Kanso']","  We use a 3D computational model to study the fluid transport and mixing due
to the beating of an infinite array of cilia. In accord with recent
experiments, we observe two distinct regions: a fluid transport region above
the cilia and a fluid mixing region below the cilia tip. The metachronal wave
due to phase differences between neighboring cilia is known to enhance the
fluid transport above the ciliary tip. In this work, we show that the
metachronal wave also enhances the mixing rates in the sub-ciliary region,
often simultaneously with the flow rate enhancement. Our results suggest that
this simultaneous enhancement in transport and mixing is due to an enhancement
in shear flow. As the flow above the cilia increases, shear rate in the fluid
increases and such shear enhances stretching, which is an essential ingredient
for mixing. Estimates of the mixing time scale indicate that, compared to
diffusion, the mixing due to the cilia beat may be significant and sometimes
dominates chemical diffusion.

Time-analyticity of Lagrangian particle trajectories in ideal fluid flow,http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6320v2,"['Vladislav Zheligovsky', 'Uriel Frisch']","  It is known that the Eulerian and Lagrangian structures of fluid flow can be
drastically different; for example, ideal fluid flow can have a trivial
(static) Eulerian structure, while displaying chaotic streamlines. Here we show
that ideal flow with limited spatial smoothness (an initial vorticity that is
just a little better than continuous), nevertheless has time-analytic
Lagrangian trajectories before the initial limited smoothness is lost. For
proving such results we use a little-known Lagrangian formulation of ideal
fluid flow derived by Cauchy in 1815 in a manuscript submitted for a prize of
the French Academy. This formulation leads to simple recurrence relations among
the time-Taylor coefficients of the Lagrangian map from initial to current
fluid particle positions; the coefficients can then be bounded using elementary
methods. We first consider various classes of incompressible fluid flow,
governed by the Euler equations, and then turn to a case of compressible flow
of cosmological relevance, governed by the Euler-Poisson equations.

particularized to give the similar solutions for ordinary and fractional

exactly, it is equal to the velocity corresponding to the motion over an

shape changes lead to larger amplitude strokes for sufficiently soft swimmers
in a viscoelastic fluid, and these stroke boosts can lead to swimming
speed-ups, but we find that additional effects of fluid elasticity generically
slow down swimmers. High amplitude strokes in strongly elastic flows lead to a
qualitatively different regime in which highly concentrated elastic stresses
accumulate near swimmer bodies and where dramatic slow-downs are seen.

performing experiments over a range of flow rates, using fluids of different

AMC of the stresses, but the invariance of the viscous forces under a global

plane, and to lead to dramatic local reductions in fluid pressure during
rupture, potentially impacting dynamic weakening processes such as thermal
pressurisation. The existence of coseismic fluid pressure drops have been
inferred from field studies, notably in gold deposits which are thought to be

lacking. Here, experimental results are presented where local on- and off-fault
fluid pressure variations were measured in situ during dynamic rock fracture

rupture, the on-fault fluid pressure dropped rapidly to zero, indicating
partial vaporisation and/or degassing. Further deformation produced stick-slip
events systematically associated with near-instantaneous drops in fluid
pressure, providing direct experimental support of the concept of ""seismic

translated into knowledge about the underlying fluid mechanics. Moreover,
machine learning algorithms can augment domain knowledge and automate tasks
related to flow control and optimization. This article presents an overview of
past history, current developments, and emerging opportunities of machine
learning for fluid mechanics. We outline fundamental machine learning
methodologies and discuss their uses for understanding, modeling, optimizing,
and controlling fluid flows. The strengths and limitations of these methods are
addressed from the perspective of scientific inquiry that links data with
modeling, experiments, and simulations. Machine learning provides a powerful
information processing framework that can augment, and possibly even transform,

the numerical framework for simulating such fluid-structure interaction

the evolution equations of the ternary fluid in an Eulerian description,
coupled to the immersed boundary method, allowing for the membrane equations of
motion to be solved in a Lagrangian system. The configuration of an elastic
capsule placed at a fluid-fluid interface is considered for validation
purposes. Systematic simulations are performed for a detailed comparison with
reference numerical results obtained by Surface Evolver, and the Galilean
invariance of the proposed model is also proven. The proposed approach is
versatile, and a wide range of geometries can be simulated. To demonstrate
this, the problem of a capillary bridge formed between two deformable capsules

Interfacial and wetting properties of a binary point Yukawa fluid,http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.5229v1,"['Paul Hopkins', 'Andrew J. Archer', 'Robert Evans']","  We investigate the interfacial phase behavior of a binary fluid mixture
composed of repulsive point Yukawa particles. Using a simple approximation for
the Helmholtz free energy functional, which yields the random phase
approximation (RPA) for the pair direct correlation functions, we calculate the
equilibrium fluid density profiles of the two species of particles adsorbed at
a planar wall. We show that for a particular choice (repulsive exponential) of
the wall potentials and the fluid pair-potential parameters, the Euler-Lagrange
equations for the equilibrium fluid density profiles may be transformed into a
single ordinary differential equation and the profiles obtained by a simple
quadrature. For certain other choices of the fluid pair-potential parameters
fluid-fluid phase separation of the bulk fluid is observed. We find that when
such a mixture is exposed to a planar hard-wall, the fluid exhibits complete
wetting on the species 2 poor side of the binodal, i.e. we observe a thick film
of fluid rich in species 2 adsorbed at the hard-wall. The thickness of the
wetting film grows logarithmically with the concentration difference between
the fluid state-point and the binodal and is proportional to the bulk
correlation length of the intruding (wetting) fluid phase. However, for state
points on the binodal that are further from the critical point, we find there
is no thick wetting film. We determine the accompanying line of first-order
(pre-wetting) surface phase transitions which separate a thin and thick
adsorbed film. We show that for some other choices of repulsive wall potentials
the pre-wetting line is still present, but its location and extent in the phase
diagram is strongly dependent on the wall-fluid interaction parameters.

Fourier's Law for a Granular Fluid,http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.1116v1,['James W. Dufty'],"  Newton' viscosity law for the momentum flux and Fourier's law for the heat
flux define Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics for a simple, one component fluid.
There is ample evidence that a hydrodynamic description applies as well to a
mesoscopic granular fluid with the same form for Newton's viscosity law.
However, theory predicts a qualitative difference for Fourier's law with an
additional contribution from density gradients even at uniform temperature. The
reasons for the absence of such terms for normal fluids are indicated, and a
related microscopic explanation for their existence in granular fluids is
presented.

A useful correspondence between fluid convection and ecosystem operation,http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.0091v1,"['S. Bruers', 'F. Meysman']","  Both ecological systems and convective fluid systems are examples of open
systems which operate far-from-equilibrium. This article demonstrates that
there is a correspondence between a resource-consumer chemostat ecosystem and
the Rayleigh-Benard (RB) convective fluid system. The Lorenz dynamics of the RB

correspondence between the dynamical equations, also the physical
interpretations show interesting analogies. By using this fluid-ecosystem
analogy, we are able to derive the correct value of the size of convection
rolls by competitive fitness arguments borrowed from ecology. We finally
conjecture that the Lorenz dynamics can be extended to describe more complex
convection patterns that resemble ecological predation.

perturbation theory. Comparison to the DCF obtained from simulation of a
Lennard-Jones fluid shows this to be a surprisingly good approximation for a

the surface tension of the liquid-vapor interface. The numerical values found

the second grade fluids equations in dimension 3. Using scaling variables and
energy estimates in weighted Sobolev spaces, we describe the first order
asymptotic profiles of these solutions. In particular, we show that the
solutions of the second grade fluids equations converge to self-similar
solutions of the heat equations, which are explicit and depend on the initial
data. Since this phenomenon occurs also for the Navier-Stokes equations, it
shows that the fluids of second grade behave asymptotically like Newtonian

Lagrangian perfect fluids and black hole mechanics,http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9610025v1,['Vivek Iyer'],"  The first law of black hole mechanics (in the form derived by Wald), is
expressed in terms of integrals over surfaces, at the horizon and spatial
infinity, of a stationary, axisymmetric black hole, in a diffeomorphism
invariant Lagrangian theory of gravity. The original statement of the first law
given by Bardeen, Carter and Hawking for an Einstein-perfect fluid system
contained, in addition, volume integrals of the fluid fields, over a spacelike
slice stretching between these two surfaces. When applied to the
Einstein-perfect fluid system, however, Wald's methods yield restricted
results. The reason is that the fluid fields in the Lagrangian of a gravitating
perfect fluid are typically nonstationary. We therefore first derive a first
law-like relation for an arbitrary Lagrangian metric theory of gravity coupled
to arbitrary Lagrangian matter fields, requiring only that the metric field be
stationary. This relation includes a volume integral of matter fields over a
spacelike slice between the black hole horizon and spatial infinity, and
reduces to the first law originally derived by Bardeen, Carter and Hawking when
the theory is general relativity coupled to a perfect fluid. We also consider a
specific Lagrangian formulation for an isentropic perfect fluid given by
Carter, and directly apply Wald's analysis. The resulting first law contains
only surface integrals at the black hole horizon and spatial infinity, but this
relation is much more restrictive in its allowed fluid configurations and
perturbations than that given by Bardeen, Carter and Hawking. In the Appendix,
we use the symplectic structure of the Einstein-perfect fluid system to derive

some order to this collection, we develop several new transformation theorems
that map perfect fluid spheres into perfect fluid spheres. These transformation
theorems sometimes lead to unexpected connections between previously known
perfect fluid spheres, sometimes lead to new previously unknown perfect fluid
spheres, and in general can be used to develop a systematic way of classifying
the set of all perfect fluid spheres. In addition, we develop new ``solution
generating'' theorems for the TOV, whereby any given solution can be
``deformed'' to a new solution. Because these TOV-based theorems work directly
in terms of the pressure profile and density profile it is relatively easy to
impose regularity conditions at the centre of the fluid sphere.

Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmological scenarios dominated by two interacting
perfect fluid components during the expansion. As a consequence of the mutual
interaction between the two fluids, neither component is conserved separately
and the energy densities are proportional to $1/t^{2}$. It is shown that in
flat FRW cosmological models there can exist interacting superpositions of two
perfect fluids (each of them having a positive energy density) which accelerate
the expansion of the universe. In this family there also exist flat power law
cosmological scenarios where one of the fluids may have a ``cosmological
constant"" or ""vacuum energy"" equation of state ($p =-\rho$) interacting with
the other component; this scenario exactly mimics the behavior of the standard
flat Friedmann solution for a single fluid with a barotropic equation of state.
These possibilities of combining interacting perfect fluids do not exist for
the non-interacting mixtures of two perfect cosmic fluids, where the general
solution for the scale factor is not described by power--law expressions and
has a more complicated behavior. In this study is considered also the
associated single fluid model interpretation for the interaction between two

"Maximally Random Jamming of Two-Dimensional One-Component and Binary

close packing) of one-component and binary hard disc fluids. The theoretical
structure used provides a common framework for description of the hard disc
liquid to hexatic, the liquid to hexagonal crystal and the liquid-to-maximally
random jammed state transitions. Our analysis is based on locating a particular
bifurcation of the solutions of the integral equation for the inhomogeneous
single particle density at the transition between different spatial structures.
The bifurcation of solutions we study is initiated from the dense metastable
fluid, and we associate it with the limit of stability of the fluid, which we
identify with the transition from the metastable fluid to a maximally random
jammed state. For the one-component hard disc fluid the predicted packing
fraction at which the metastable fluid to maximally random jammed state
transition occurs is 0.84, in excellent agreement with the experimental value
0.84 \pm 0.02. The corresponding analysis of the limit of stability of a binary
hard disc fluid with specified disc diameter ratio and disc composition
requires extra approximations in the representations of the direct correlation
function, the equation of state, and the number of order parameters accounted
for. Keeping only the order parameter identified with the largest peak in the
structure factor of the highest density regular lattice with the same disc
diameter ratio and disc composition as the binary fluid, the predicted density
of maximally random jamming is found to be 0.84 to 0.87, depending on the
equation of state used, and very weakly dependent on the ratio of disc
diameters and the fluid composition, in agreement with both experimental data

assumed the variation law for the mean Hubble parameter that yields a constant

produced in the presence of isotropic fluid in accordance with the \Lambda CDM

able to allow kinematics that cannot be produced in the presence of fluids that
yield only isotropic pressure. We have obtained well behaving cases where the
anisotropy of the expansion and the anisotropy of the fluid converge to finite

infinitesimal size which do not produce significant perturbations of the fluid

Analysis of Boundary Slip in a Flow with an Oscillating Wall,http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.7090v1,"['Joseph John Thalakkottor', 'Kamran Mohseni']","  Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation is used to study slip at the fluid-solid
boundary in an unsteady flow based on the Stokes second problem. An increase in
slip is observed in comparison to the steady flow for shear rates below the
critical shear rate of the corresponding steady flow. This increased slip is
attributed to fluid inertial forces not represented in a steady flow. An
unsteady mathematical model for slip is established, which estimates the
increment in slip at the boundary. The model shows that slip is also dependent
on acceleration in addition to the shear rate of fluid at the wall. By writing
acceleration in terms of shear rate, it is shown that slip at the wall in
unsteady flows is governed by the gradient of shear rate and shear rate of the
fluid. Non-dimensionalizing the model gives a universal curve which can be used
to find the slip boundary condition at the fluid-solid interface based on the
information of shear rate and gradient of shear rate of the fluid. A governing
non-dimensional number, defined as the ratio of phase speed to speed of sound,
is identified to help in explaining the mechanism responsible for the
transition of slip boundary condition from finite to a perfect slip and
determining when this would occur. Phase lag in fluid velocity relative to wall
is observed. The lag increases with decreasing time period of wall oscillation
and increasing wall hydrophobicity. The phenomenon of hysteresis is seen when
looking into the variation of slip velocity as a function of wall velocity and
slip velocity as a function of fluid shear rate. The cause for hysteresis is
attributed to the unsteady inertial forces of the fluid.

fluid-particle flows with a two-way coupled Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
(SPH) for the fluid and the Discrete Element Method (DEM) for the solid phase.
The unresolved fluid model, based on the locally averaged Navier Stokes
equations, is expected to be considerably faster than fully resolved models.
Furthermore, in contrast to similar mesh-based Discrete Particle Methods
(DPMs), our purely particle-based method enjoys the flexibility that comes from
the lack of a prescribed mesh. It is suitable for problems such as free surface
flow or flow around complex, moving and/or intermeshed geometries and is
applicable to both dilute and dense particle flows.
  Second, a comprehensive validation procedure for fluid-particle simulations
is presented and applied here to the SPH-DEM method, using simulations of
single and multiple particle sedimentation in a 3D fluid column and comparison
with analytical models. Millimetre-sized particles are used along with three
different test fluids: air, water and a water-glycerol solution. The velocity
evolution for a single particle compares well (less than 1% error) with the
analytical solution as long as the fluid resolution is coarser than two times
the particle diameter. Two more complex multiple particle sedimentation
problems (sedimentation of a homogeneous porous block and an inhomogeneous
Rayleigh Taylor instability) are also reproduced well for porosities 0.6 <=
\epsilon <= 1.0, although care should be taken in the presence of high porosity

Murray's law revisited: QuÃ©mada's fluid model and fractal trees,http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03546v4,"['Baptiste Moreau', 'Benjamin Mauroy']","  In 1926, Murray proposed the first law for the optimal design of blood
vessels. He minimized the power dissipation arising from the trade-off between
fluid circulation and blood maintenance. The law, based on a constant fluid
viscosity, states that in the optimal configuration the fluid flow rate inside
the vessel is proportional to the cube of the vessel radius, implying that wall
shear stress is not dependent on the vessel radius. Murray's law has been found
to be true in blood macrocirculation, but not in microcirculation. In 2005,
Alarc\'on et al took into account the non monotonous dependence of viscosity on
vessel radius - F{\aa}hr{\ae}us-Lindqvist effect - due to phase separation
effect of blood. They were able to predict correctly the behavior of wall shear
stresses in microcirculation. One last crucial step remains however: to account
for the dependence of blood viscosity on shear rates. In this work, we
investigate how viscosity dependence on shear rate affects Murray's law. We
extended Murray's optimal design to the whole range of Qu\'emada's fluids, that
models pseudo-plastic fluids such as blood. Our study shows that Murray's
original law is not restricted to Newtonian fluids, it is actually universal
for all Qu\'emada's fluid as long as there is no phase separation effect. When
phase separation effect occurs, then we derive an extended version of Murray's
law. Our analyses are very general and apply to most of fluids with shear
dependent rheology. Finally, we study how these extended laws affect the
optimal geometries of fractal trees to mimic an idealized arterial network.

Micropolarity-Ramification of Laminar/Turbulent Circular-Plane-Jet,http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04692v1,['Abuzar Abid Siddiqui'],"  In the present work we formulated the boundary-value-problem, comprising
partial differential equations (PDEs) of steady flow for laminar/turbulent
circular jet of a micropolar fluid. A new boundary layer-similarity
transformation/solution was derived which is valid not only for the Newtonian
fluids but also for the micropolar fluids. Through this transformation PDEs are
transformed into the ordinary differential equations (ODEs). These ODEs were
solved numerically by the finite-difference method. The obtained results were
compared with existing results [9] for the Newtonian fluids. The comparison was
favourable. The micropolarity influences were highlighted in the present work.
The axial-fluid-speed and normal stress-component decreases but
radial-fluid-speed, microspin and one of the normal stress-component increase
as the micropolarity effect enhances. The fluid-speed, microspin, shear
stresses, normal stresses and couple stresses are dominant in the vicinity of
the jet-source whereas they all vanish as far away from the jet-source
analogous to the plane-jet-flow [8]. In addition, axial-speed, discharge,
microspin, shear stresses and the components of couple stress intensify with z
linearly but radial velocity, normal stresses and the component of couple
stress are independent of z. The micropolarity-effects on discharge diminish if
the diameter of jet-source reduces. Analogous to the plane-jet-flow [8],
teace(stress tensor)=0, for the micropolar as well as for the Newtonian fluids.
The normal stresses decreases as r goes on increasing, analogous to the
shear-stresses. But all the normal components of the couple stress tensor
vanish. The couple stress tensor is symmetric and skew-symmetric if analogous
to the plane-jet flow [8]. Finally the fluid-speed will also intensify if
turbulent-influences are enhanced.

"Turbulent mixing and a generalized phase transition in shear-thickening
  fluids",http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07012v1,"['Helmut Z. Baumert', 'Bernhard Wessling']","  This paper presents a new theory of turbulent mixing in stirred reactors. The
degree of homogeneity of a mixed fluid may be characterized by the Kolmogorov
micro-scale. The smaller its value, the better homogeneity. The micro-scale
scales inversely with the fourth root of the energy dissipation rate in the
stirring process. The higher this rate, the smaller lambda, and the better the
homogeneity in the reactor. This is true for Newtonian fluids. In non-Newtonian
fluids the situation is different. For instance, in shear-thickening fluids it
is plausible that high shear rates thicken the fluid and might strangle the
mixing. The internal interactions between different fluid-mechanical and
colloidal variables are subtle, namely due to the (until recently) very limited
understanding of turbulence. Starting from a qualitatively new turbulence
theory for inviscid fluids [Baumert, 2013], giving e.g. the Karman constant as
$(2\pi)^{-1/2} = 0.40$ [the super-pipe in Princeton gave 0.40 p/m 0.02, Bailey
et al., 2014], we generalize this approach to the case of viscous fluids and
derive equations which in the steady state exhibit two solutions. One solution
branch describes a state of good mixing, the other a state of strangled
turbulence. The physical system cannot be in two different steady states at the
same time. But it is physically admissible to switch between the two steady
states by non-stationary transitions, maybe in a chaotic fashion.

longitudinal vibration of bipyramidal nanoparticles, the effects of fluid
compressibility were shown to be negligible, we demonstrate that it plays a
significant role in the breathing mode of an elastic sphere. On the other hand,
despite the different vibration modes, the breathing mode of a sphere triggers
a viscoelastic response in water-glycerol mixtures similar to that triggered by
the longitudinal vibration of bipyramidal nanoparticles. We also comment on the

Magnetohydrodynamic motion of a two-fluid plasma,http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02654v1,['J. W. Burby'],"  The two-fluid Maxwell system couples frictionless electron and ion fluids via
Maxwell's equations. When the frequencies of light waves, Langmuir waves, and
single-particle cyclotron motion are scaled to be asymptotically large, the
two-fluid Maxwell system becomes a fast-slow dynamical system. This fast-slow
system admits a formally-exact single-fluid closure that may be computed
systematically with any desired order of accuracy through the use of a
functional partial differential equation. In the leading order approximation,
the closure reproduces magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Higher order truncations of
the closure give an infinite hierarchy of extended MHD models that allow for
arbitrary mass ratio, as well as perturbative deviations from charge
neutrality. The closure is interpreted geometrically as an invariant slow
manifold in the infinite-dimensional two-fluid phase space, on which two-fluid
motions are free of high-frequency oscillations. This perspective shows that
the full closure inherits a Hamiltonian structure from two-fluid theory. By
employing infinite-dimensional Lie transforms, the Poisson bracket for the
all-orders closure may be obtained in closed form. Thus, conservative
truncations of the single-fluid closure may be obtained by simply truncating
the single-fluid Hamiltonian. Moreover, the closed-form expression for the
all-orders bracket gives explicit expressions for a number of the full
closure's conservation laws. Notably, the full closure, as well as any of its
Hamiltonian truncations, admits a pair of independent circulation invariants.

the modulus for liquid argon at its normal boiling point (87.3~K) adsorbed in
model silica pores of two different morphologies and various sizes. For
spherical pores, for all the pore sizes (diameters) exceeding 2~nm, we obtained
a logarithmic dependence of fluid modulus on the vapor pressure. Calculation of
the modulus at saturation showed that the modulus of the fluid in spherical
pores is a linear function of the reciprocal pore size. The calculation of the
modulus of the fluid in cylindrical pores appeared too scattered to make
quantitative conclusions. We performed additional simulations at higher
temperature (119.6~K), at which Monte Carlo insertions and removals become more

regularities for cylindrical pores and showed quantitative difference between
the fluid moduli in pores of different geometries. Both of the observed

mismatch between the fluid and solid meshes over a cylindrical tubular elastic

suspended in the flow, employing both one and two-way thermal coupling, in a
statistically stationary, isotropic turbulent flow. Using statistical analysis,
we investigate this variegated interaction at the different scales of the flow.
We find that the variance of the fluid temperature gradients decreases as the
thermal response time of the suspended particles is increased. The probability
density function (PDF) of the fluid temperature gradients scales with its
variance, while the PDF of the rate of change of the particle temperature,
whose variance is associated with the thermal dissipation due to the particles,
does not scale in such a self-similar way. The modification of the fluid
temperature field due to the particles is examined by computing the particle
concentration and particle heat fluxes conditioned on the magnitude of the
local fluid temperature gradient. These statistics highlight that the particles
cluster on the fluid temperature fronts, and the important role played by the
alignments of the particle velocity and the local fluid temperature gradient.
The temperature structure functions, which characterize the temperature
fluctuations across the scales of the flow, clearly show that the fluctuations
of the fluid temperature increments are monotonically suppressed in the two-way
coupled regime as the particle thermal response time is increased. Thermal
caustics dominate the particle temperature increments at small scales, that is,
particles that come into contact are likely to have very large differences in
their temperature. This is caused by the nonlocal thermal dynamics of the
particles...

and capillarity forces in a porous medium. The main interest is the
stabilization of the fluid in Rayleigh-Taylor unstable situations where the
fluid lays on top of a dry region. An important feature considered here is that
the layer of fluid is under an impervious wall. This physical situation have
been widely study by mean of thin film approximations in the case of small
characteristic high of the fluid considering its strong interaction with the
fixed boundary. Here, instead of considering any simplification leading to
asymptotic models, we deal with the complete free boundary problem. We prove
that, if the fluid interface is smaller than an explicit constant, the solution
is global in time and it becomes instantly analytic. In particular, the fluid
does not form drops in finite time. Our results are stated in terms of Wiener
spaces for the interface together with some non-standard Wiener-Sobolev
anisotropic spaces required to describe the regularity of the fluid pressure
and velocity. These Wiener-Sobolev spaces are of independent interest as they
can be useful in other problems. Finally, let us remark that our techniques do
not rely on the irrotational character of the fluid in the bulk and they can be
applied to other free boundary problems.

Variational description of multi-fluid hydrodynamics: Uncharged fluids,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0209024v3,['Reinhard Prix'],"  We present a formalism for Newtonian multi-fluid hydrodynamics derived from
an unconstrained variational principle. This approach provides a natural way of
obtaining the general equations of motion for a wide range of hydrodynamic
systems containing an arbitrary number of interacting fluids and superfluids.
In addition to spatial variations we use ``time shifts'' in the variational
principle, which allows us to describe dissipative processes with entropy
creation, such as chemical reactions, friction or the effects of external
non-conservative forces. The resulting framework incorporates the
generalization of the entrainment effect originally discussed in the case of
the mixture of two superfluids by Andreev and Bashkin. In addition to the
conservation of energy and momentum, we derive the generalized conservation
laws of vorticity and helicity, and the special case of Ertel's theorem for the
single perfect fluid.
  We explicitly discuss the application of this framework to thermally
conducting fluids, superfluids, and superfluid neutron star matter. The
equations governing thermally conducting fluids are found to be more general
than the standard description, as the effect of entrainment usually seems to be
overlooked in this context. In the case of superfluid He4 we recover the
Landau--Khalatnikov equations of the two-fluid model via a translation to the
``orthodox'' framework of superfluidity, which is based on a rather awkward
choice of variables. Our two-fluid model for superfluid neutron star matter
allows for dissipation via mutual friction and also ``transfusion'' via
beta-reactions between the neutron fluid and the proton-electron fluid.

  conditions for vanishing viscosity of compressible Navier-Stokes equations",http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07214v2,['Dejan Kovacevic'],"  In this paper, we perform analysis of the fluid velocity vector field
divergence $\nabla \cdot \vec{u}$ derived from the continuity equation, and we
explore its application in the Navier-Stokes equations for compressible fluids
$\rho (\vec{x},t)\ne const$, occupying all of $\vec{x}\in R^{3} $ space at any
$t\geq 0$. The resulting velocity vector field divergence $\nabla \cdot
\vec{u}=-\frac{1}{\rho } (\frac{\partial \rho }{\partial t} +\vec{u}\cdot
\nabla \rho )$ is a direct consequence of the fluid density rate of change over
time $\frac{\partial \rho }{\partial t}$ and over space $\nabla \rho $, in
addition to the fluid velocity vector field $\vec{u}(\vec{x},t)$ and the fluid
density $\rho (\vec{x},t)$ itself. We derive the conditions for the
divergence-free fluid velocity vector field $\nabla \cdot \vec{u}=0$ in
scenarios when the fluid density is not constant $\rho(\vec{x},t)\neq const$
over space nor time, and we analyze scenarios of the non-zero divergence
$\nabla \cdot \vec{u}\ne 0$. We apply the statement for divergence in the
Navier-Stokes equation for compressible fluids, and we deduct the condition for
vanishing (zero) viscosity term of the compressible Navier-Stokes equation:
$\nabla (\frac{1}{\rho } (\frac{\partial \rho }{\partial t} +\vec{u}\cdot
\nabla \rho ))=-3\Delta \vec{u}$. In addition to that, we derive even more
elementary condition for vanishing viscosity, stating that vanishing viscosity
is triggered once scalar function $d(\vec{x},t)=-\frac{1}{\rho }
(\frac{\partial \rho }{\partial t} +\vec{u}\cdot \nabla \rho )$ is harmonic
function. Once that condition is satisfied, the viscosity related term of the
Navier-Stokes equations for compressible fluids equals to zero, which is known
as related to turbulent fluid flows.

"Physics of Rheologically-Enhanced Propulsion: Different Strokes in
  Generalized Stokes",http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1076v1,"['Thomas D. Montenegro-Johnson', 'Daniel Loghin', 'David J. Smith']","  Shear-thinning is an important rheological property of many biological
fluids, such as mucus, whereby the apparent viscosity of the fluid decreases
with shear. Certain microscopic swimmers have been shown to progress more
rapidly through shear-thinning fluids, but is this behavior generic to all
microscopic swimmers, and what are the physics through which shear-thinning
rheology affects a swimmer's propulsion? We examine swimmers employing
prescribed stroke kinematics in two-dimensional, inertialess Carreau fluid:
shear-thinning ""Generalized Stokes"" flow. Swimmers are modeled, using the
method of femlets, by a set of immersed, regularized forces. The equations
governing the fluid dynamics are then discretized over a body-fitted mesh and
solved with the finite element method. We analyze the locomotion of three
distinct classes of microswimmer: (1) conceptual swimmers comprising sliding
spheres employing both one- and two-dimensional strokes, (2) slip-velocity
envelope models of ciliates commonly referred to as ""squirmers"" and (3)
monoflagellate pushers, such as sperm. We find that morphologically identical
swimmers with different strokes may swim either faster or slower in
shear-thinning fluids than in Newtonian fluids. We explain this kinematic
sensitivity by considering differences in the viscosity of the fluid
surrounding propulsive and payload elements of the swimmer, and using this
insight suggest two reciprocal sliding sphere swimmers which violate Purcell's
Scallop theorem in shear-thinning fluids. We also show that an increased flow
decay rate arising from shear-thinning rheology is associated with a reduction
in the swimming speed of slip-velocity squirmers. For sperm-like swimmers, a
gradient of thick to thin fluid along the flagellum alters the force it exerts
upon the fluid, flattening trajectories and increasing instantaneous swimming
speed.

their numerous applications, such as plastic manufacture and extrusion of
polymer fluids. They are more complex than Newtonian fluids because the
relationship between shear stress and shear rate is nonlinear. One particular
subclass of non-Newtonian fluids is the generalized Oldroyd-B fluid, which is
modelled using terms involving multi-term time fractional diffusion and
reaction. In this paper, we consider the application of the finite difference
method for this class of novel multi-term time fractional viscoelastic
non-Newtonian fluid models. An important contribution of the work is that the
new model not only has a multi-term time derivative, of which the fractional
order indices range from 0 to 2, but also possesses a special time fractional
operator on the spatial derivative that is challenging to approximate. There
appears to be no literature reported on the numerical solution of this type of
equation. We derive two new different finite difference schemes to approximate
the model. Then we establish the stability and convergence analysis of these
schemes based on the discrete $H^1$ norm and prove that their accuracy is of
$O(\tau+h^2)$ and $O(\tau^{\min\{3-\gamma_s,2-\alpha_q,2-\beta\}}+h^2)$,
respectively. Finally, we verify our methods using two numerical examples and
apply the schemes to simulate an unsteady magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Couette

be extended to solve other non-Newtonian fluid models such as the generalized

"Effective potentials for polymers and colloids: Beyond the van der Waals
  picture of fluids?",http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0102220v2,['A. A. Louis'],"  This contribution briefly reviews some recent work demonstrating the partial
breakdown of the colloidal fluid <--> atomic fluid analogy. The success of
liquid state theory for atomic fluids stems in part from the van der Waals
picture, where steric interactions dominate the structure, and attractive
interactions can be added as a perturbation. For complex fluids described by
effective potentials, this picture may break down. In the first example
discussed, depletion potentials in non-additive hard-sphere mixtures are shown
to be surprisingly complex, leading to fluid structure and fluid-solid
transitions dominated by properties of the attractive potentials instead of by
the hard-cores. Many colloidal suspensions, and possibly globular proteins,
fall into this {\em energetic fluid} category. In the second example, the
coarse-graining of polymers leads to soft-core effective potentials and
associated {\em mean field fluid} behaviour distinguished by a breakdown of the
virial expansion, an equation of state that is nevertheless nearly linear in
density, and correlation functions well described by the random phase
approximation.

Probing structural relaxation in complex fluids by critical fluctuations,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0401166v1,"['A. F. Kostko', 'M. A. Anisimov', 'J. V. Sengers']","  Complex fluids, such as polymer solutions and blends, colloids and gels, are
of growing interest in fundamental and applied soft-condensed-matter science. A
common feature of all such systems is the presence of a mesoscopic structural
length scale intermediate between atomic and macroscopic scales. This
mesoscopic structure of complex fluids is often fragile and sensitive to
external perturbations. Complex fluids are frequently viscoelastic (showing a
combination of viscous and elastic behaviour) with their dynamic response
depending on the time and length scales. Recently, non-invasive methods to
infer the rheological response of complex fluids have gained popularity through
the technique of microrheology, where the diffusion of probe spheres in a
viscoelastic fluid is monitored with the aid of light scattering or microscopy.
Here we propose an alternative to traditional microrheology that does not
require doping of probe particles in the fluid (which can sometimes drastically
alter the molecular environment). Instead, our proposed method makes use of the
phenomenon of ""avoided crossing"" between modes associated with the structural
relaxation and critical fluctuations that are spontaneously generated in the
system.

phase. On reducing the separation between the two big particles we find there
can be a `bridging' transition as the wetting films join to form a fluid
bridge. The potential between the two big particles becomes long ranged and
strongly attractive in the bridged configuration. Within our mean-field
treatment the bridging transition results in a discontinuity in the solvent
mediated force. We demonstrate that accounting for the phenomenon of bridging

and lengths of transverse and longitudinal waves in the fluid. The angular
dependencies of the absorptivity are demonstrated to have significant and
unusual structure near critical angles of incidence. The effect of
non-Newtonian properties and non-uniformities of the fluid layer on the
absorptivity is also investigated. In particular, it is shown that the

  fluids",http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.1467v1,['Yuri Martinez-Raton'],"  In this article we calculate the surface phase diagram of a two-dimensional
hard-rod fluid confined between two hard lines. In a first stage we study the
semi-infinite system consisting of an isotropic fluid in contact with a single
hard line. We have found complete wetting by the columnar phase at the
wall-isotropic fluid interface. When the fluid is confined between two hard
walls, capillary columnar ordering occurs via a first-order phase transition.
For higher chemical potentials the system exhibits layering transitions even
for very narrow slits (near the one-dimensional limit). The theoretical model
used was a density-functional theory based on the Fundamental-Measure
Functional applied to a fluid of hard rectangles in the restricted-orientation
approximation (Zwanzig model). The results presented here can be checked
experimentally in two-dimensional granular media made of rods, where vertical
motions induced by an external source and excluded volume interactions between
the grains allow the system to explore those stationary states which
entropically maximize packing configurations. We claim that some of the surface
phenomena found here can be present in two-dimensional granular-media fluids.

Energy of interaction between solid surfaces and liquids,http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.4481v1,['Henri Gouin'],"  We consider the wetting transition on a planar surface in contact with a
semi-infinite fluid. In the classical approach, the surface is assumed to be
solid, and when interaction between solid and fluid is sufficiently
short-range, the contribution of the fluid can be represented by a surface free
energy with a density of the form Phi(rho_s), where rho_s is the limiting
density of the fluid at the surface. In the present paper we propose a more
precise representation of the surface energy that takes into account not only
the value of rho_s but also the contribution from the whole density profile
rho(z) of the fluid, where z is the coordinate normal to the surface. The
specific value of the functional of rho_s at the surface is expressed in
mean-field approximation through the potentials of intermolecular interaction
and some other parameters of the fluid and the solid wall. An extension to the
case of fluid mixtures in contact with a solid surface is proposed.

Newtonian limit for weakly viscoelastic fluid flows of Olroyds' type,http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0228v1,"['Luc Molinet', 'Raafat Talhouk']","  This paper is concerned with regular flows of incompressible weakly
viscoelastic fluids which obey a differential constitutive law of Oldroyd type.
  We study the newtonian limit for weakly viscoelastic fluid flows in $\R^N$ or
$\T^N$ for $N=2, 3$, when the Weissenberg number (relaxation time measuring the
elasticity effect in the fluid) tends to zero. More precisely, we prove that
the velocity field and the extra-stress tensor converge in their existence
spaces (we examine the Sobolev-$H^s$ theory and the Besov-$B^{s,1}_2$ theory to
reach the critical case $s= N/2$) to the corresponding newtonian quantities.
  These convergence results are established in the case of ""ill-prepared""'

existence of weakly viscoelastic fluids flow. Our approach makes use of
essentially two ingredients : the stability of the null solution of the
viscoelastic fluids flow and the damping effect,on the difference between the
extra-stress tensor and the tensor of rate of deformation, induced by the

IKT approach for quantum hydrodynamic equations,http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.4664v1,"['M. Tessarotto', 'M. Ellero', 'P. Nicolini']","  A striking feature of standard quantum mechanics is its analogy with
classical fluid dynamics. In particular it is well known the Schr\""{o}dinger
equation can be viewed as describing a classical compressible and non-viscous
fluid, described by two (quantum) fluid fields ${\rho ,% \mathbf{V}} $, to be
identified with the quantum probability density and velocity field. This
feature has suggested the construction of a phase-space hidden-variable
description based on a suitable inverse kinetic theory (IKT; Tessarotto et al.,
2007). The discovery of this approach has potentially important consequences
since it permits to identify the classical dynamical system which advances in
time the quantum fluid fields. This type of approach, however requires the
identification of additional fluid fields. These can be generally identified
with suitable directional fluid temperatures $T_{QM,i}$ (for $i=1,2,3$), to be
related to the expectation values of momentum fluctuations appearing in the
Heisenberg inequalities. Nevertheless the definition given previously for them
(Tessarotto et al., 2007) is non-unique. In this paper we intend to propose a
criterion, based on the validity of a constant H-theorem, which provides an
unique definition for the quantum temperatures.

Transition to turbulence through decline of viscosity,http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.0950v1,['K. Y. Volokh'],"  Experiments (Mullin and Kreswell, 2005) show that transition to turbulence
can start at Reynolds numbers lower than it is predicted by the linear
stability analysis - the subcritical transition to turbulence. To explain these
observations qualitatively we suggest that the onset of subcritical instability
is related to decline of viscosity of the fluid: friction between fluid layers
fails with the increase of the velocity gradient. To describe the declinie of
friction theoretically we relax the the assumption of the stability of the
fluid material and introduce a constant of fluid strength. Particularly, we
enhance the Navier-Stokes model with a failure description by introducing the
fluid strength in the constitutive equation for the viscous stress. The
clasical model is obtained from the enhanced one when strength goes to
infinity. We use the modified Navier-Stokes model to analyze the Couette flow
between two parallel plates and find that the lateral perturbations can
destabilize the flow and the critical Reynolds number is proportional to the
fluid strength. The latter means that the classical Navier-Stokes model of a
stable material with infinite strength does not capture the subcritical
transition to turbulence while the mofified model does.

prediction of the fluid velocity spatial autocorrelation function. Even for
uncorrelated swimmers, the theory predicts anticorrelations between nearby
fluid elements that correspond to vortex-like swirling motions in the fluid
with length scale set by the size of a swimmer and the slit height. Very
similar results arise from the full simulations indicating either that
correlated motion of the swimmers is not significant at the concentrations
considered or that the fluid phase autocorrelation is not a sensitive measure
of the correlated motion. This result is in stark contrast with results from
unconfined systems, for which the fluid autocorrelation captures large-scale
collective fluid structures. The additional length scale (screening length)
introduced by the confinement seems to prevent these large-scale structures
from forming.

components while only one is necessary for the description of an ordinary

behavior for a classical fluid, tentatively turbulent if particular conditions

study evolution of Alfvenic modes in partially ionized astrophysical and space
plasmas. The partially ionized plasma consists mainly of electrons, ions and
significant neutral atoms. The nonlinear interactions amongst these species
take place predominantly through direct collision or charge exchange processes.
Our model uniquely describe the interaction processes between two distinctly

Both plasma and neutral fluids are treated with different energy equations that
adequately enable us to monitor non adiabatic and thermal energy exchange

energy transfer takes place between plasma and neutral fluids. We describe the
mode coupling processes that lead to the energy transfer between the plasma and

Interacting Kasner-type cosmologies,http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.2147v1,"['Mauricio Cataldo', 'Fabiola Arevalo', 'Patricio Mella']","  It is well known that Kasner-type cosmologies provide a useful framework for
analyzing the three-dimensional anisotropic expansion because of the
simplification of the anisotropic dynamics. In this paper relativistic
multi-fluid Kasner-type scenarios are studied. We first consider the general
case of a superposition of two ideal cosmic fluids, as well as the particular
cases of non-interacting and interacting ones, by introducing a
phenomenological coupling function $q(t)$. For two-fluid cosmological scenarios
there exist only cosmological scaling solutions, while for three-fluid
configurations there exist not only cosmological scaling ones, but also more
general solutions. In the case of triply interacting cosmic fluids we can have
energy transfer from two fluids to a third one, or energy transfer from one
cosmic fluid to the other two. It is shown that by requiring the positivity of
energy densities there always is a matter component which violates the dominant
energy condition in this kind of anisotropic cosmological scenarios.

inertia forces in fluid dynamics with the inertia forces in electromagnetism
that are known to induce resistance forces on masses both due to acceleration
and at constant velocity. It is shown that the force exerted on a particle by
an ideal fluid produces two effects: i) resistance to acceleration and, ii) an
increase of mass with velocity. These resistance forces arise due to the fluid
dragged by the particle, where the bare mass of the particle at rest changes
when in motion (""dressed"" particle). It is demonstrated that the vector
potential created by a charged particle in motion acts as an ideal space flow
that surrounds the particle. The interaction between the particle and the
entrained space flow gives rise to the observed properties of inertia and the
relativistic increase of mass. Parallels are made between the inertia property
of matter, electromagnetism and the hydrodynamic drag in potential flow.
Accordingly, in this framework the non resistance of a particle in uniform
motion through an ideal fluid (D'Alembert's paradox) corresponds to Newton's
first law. The law of inertia suggests that the physical vacuum can be modeled
as an ideal fluid, agreeing with the space-time ideal fluid approach from

angles. More generally, the approach permits novel means to study contact
lines, as well as a diverse range of phenomena that previously could not be

Polymer additives in fluid turbulence and distributed chaos,http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09291v1,['A. Bershadskii'],"  The fluids and polymers have different fundamental symmetries. Namely, the
Lagrangian relabeling symmetry of fluids is absent for polymers (while the
translational and rotational symmetries are still present). This fact results
in spontaneous breaking of the relabeling symmetry in fluid turbulence even at
a tiny polymer addition. Since helicity conservation in inviscid fluid motions
is a consequence of the relabeling symmetry (due to the Noether's theorem)
violation of this conservation by the polymer additives results in the strong
effects in the distributed chaos. The distributed chaos in turbulence with the
spontaneously broken relabeling symmetry is characterized by stretched
exponential spectra $\propto \exp(-k/k_{\beta})^{\beta}$ with $\beta =2/5$. The
spectral range of this distributed chaos is extended in direction of the small
wavenumbers and $k_{\beta}$ becomes much larger in comparison with the pure

Phase-separation models for swimming enhancement in complex fluids,http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08286v1,"['Yi Man', 'Eric Lauga']","  Swimming cells often have to self-propel through fluids displaying
non-Newtonian rheology. While past theoretical work seems to indicate that
stresses arising from complex fluids should systematically hinder low-Reynolds
number locomotion, experimental observations suggest that locomotion
enhancement is possible. In this paper we propose a physical mechanism for
locomotion enhancement of microscopic swimmers in a complex fluid. It is based
on the fact that micro-structured fluids will generically phase-separate near
surfaces, leading to the presence of low-viscosity layers which promote slip
and decrease viscous friction near the surface of the swimmer. We use two
models to address the consequence of this phase separation: a nonzero apparent
slip length for the fluid and then an explicit modeling of the change of
viscosity in a thin layer near the swimmer. Considering two canonical setups
for low-Reynolds number locomotion, namely the waving locomotion of a
two-dimensional sheet and that of a three-dimensional filament, we show that
phase-separation systematically increases the locomotion speeds, possibly by
orders of magnitude. We close by confronting our predictions with recent

electromagnetism coupled to other modes. For null configurations,
electromagnetism can be described as a null pressureless fluid, for which we
can find solutions from the knotted solutions of electromagnetism. We also map
them to solutions of Euler's equations, obtained from a type of nonrelativistic

Fluid-loaded metasurfaces,http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08407v1,"['E. A. Skelton', 'R. V. Craster', 'A. Colombi', 'D. J. Colquitt']","  We consider wave propagation along fluid-loaded structures which take the
form of an elastic plate augmented by an array of resonators forming a
metasurface, that is, a surface structured with sub-wavelength resonators. Such
surfaces have had considerable recent success for the control of wave
propagation in electromagnetism and acoustics, by combining the vision of
sub-wavelength wave manipulation, with the design, fabrication and size
advantages associated with surface excitation. We explore one aspect of recent
interest in this field: graded metasurfaces, but within the context of
fluid-loaded structures.
  Graded metasurfaces allow for selective spatial frequency separation and are
often referred to as exhibiting rainbow trapping. Experiments, and theory, have
been developed for acoustic, electromagnetic, and even elastic, rainbow devices
but this has not been approached for fluid-loaded structures that support
surface waves coupled with the acoustic field in a bulk fluid. This surface
wave, coupled with the fluid, can be used to create an additional effect by
designing a metasurface to mode convert from surface to bulk waves. We
demonstrate that sub-wavelength control is possible and that one can create
both rainbow trapping and mode conversion phenomena for a fluid-loaded elastic

which concerns the motion of an oscillating boundary, our numerical analysis
predicts that a periodically rotating ring will oscillate at a higher frequency
in an active fluid than in a passive fluid, due to an activity-induced
reduction of the fluid inertia. In the case of a freely suspended
fluid-container system that is isolated from external forces or torques, active
fluid stresses can induce large fluctuations in the container's angular
momentum if the confinement radius matches certain multiples of the intrinsic
vortex size of the active suspension. This effect could be utilized to
transform collective microscopic swimmer activity into macroscopic motion in

Pulsing corals: A story of scale and mixing,http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04996v1,"['Julia E. Samson', 'Nicholas A. Battista', 'Shilpa Khatri', 'Laura A. Miller']","  Effective methods of fluid transport vary across scale. A commonly used
dimensionless number for quantifying the effective scale of fluid transport is
the Reynolds number, Re, which gives the ratio of inertial to viscous forces.
What may work well for one Re regime may not produce significant flows for
another. These differences in scale have implications for many organisms,
ranging from the mechanics of how organisms move through their fluid
environment to how hearts pump at various stages in development. Some
organisms, such as soft pulsing corals, actively contract their tentacles to
generate mixing currents that enhance photosynthesis. Their unique morphology
and intermediate scale where both viscous and inertial forces are significant
make them a unique model organism for understanding fluid mixing. In this
paper, 3D fluid-structure interaction simulations of a pulsing soft coral are
used to quantify fluid transport and fluid mixing across a wide range of Re.
The results show that net transport is negligible for $Re<10$, and continuous
upward flow is produced for $Re\geq 10$.

multicomponent compressible stratified fluid, accounting for the effects of
diabatic sinks and sources. As for simple compressible fluids, the total
potential energy density of a fluid parcel is the sum of its available elastic
energy (AEE) and APE density. These respectively represent the adiabatic
compression/expansion work needed to bring it from its reference pressure to
its actual pressure and the work against buoyancy forces required to move it
from its reference state position to its actual position. Our expression for
the APE density is new and derived using only elementary manipulations of the
equations of motion; it is significantly simpler than existing published
expressions, while also being more transparently linked to the relevant form of
APE density for the Boussinesq and hydrostatic primitive equations. Our new
framework is used to clarify the links between some aspects of the energetics
of Boussinesq and real fluids, as well as to shed light on the physical basis
underlying the choice of reference state(s) in local APE theory.

the results on the NMRT problem to the stratified MHD fluid case. We point out
that our magnetic inhibition theory can be used to explain the inhibition

step of all fluids obtained according to CFL conditions to evolve the fluid

solving the governing equations of each individual fluid with the corresponding

The interaction step between two fluids is solved for synchronization, which is
handled by interpolating the intermediate states of fluid with larger

to maintain the conservative property. The present method can be combined with
a wavelet-based adaptive multi-resolution algorithm (Han et al., JCP, 2014) to
achieve additional computational efficiency. A number of numerical tests

A metamaterial-free fluid-flow cloak,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07169v1,"['Fuyang Tay', 'Youming Zhang', 'Hongyi Xu', 'Honghui Goh', 'Yu Luo', 'Baile Zhang']","  The model of ideal fluid flow around a cylindrical obstacle exhibits a
long-established physical picture where originally straight streamlines will be
deflected over the whole space by the obstacle. As inspired by transformation
optics and metamaterials, recent theories have proposed the concept of fluid
cloaking able to recover the straight streamlines as if the obstacle does not
exist. However, such a cloak, similar to all previous
transformation-optics-based devices, relies on complex metamaterials, being
difficult to implement. Here we deploy the theory of scattering cancellation
and report on the experimental realization of a fluid-flow cloak without
metamaterials. This cloak is realized by engineering the geometry of the fluid
channel, which effectively cancels the dipole-like scattering of the obstacle.
The cloaking effect is demonstrated via direct observation of the recovered
straight streamlines in the fluid flow with injected dyes. Our work sheds new
light on conventional fluid control and may find applications in microfluidic
devices.

Jeffery orbits in shear-thinning fluids,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08687v2,"['S. Arman Abtahi', 'Gwynn J. Elfring']","  We investigate the dynamics of a prolate spheroid in a shear flow of a
shear-thinning Carreau fluid. The motion of a prolate particle is developed
analytically for asymptotically weak shear thinning and then integrated
numerically. We find that shear-thinning rheology does not lift the degeneracy
of Jeffery orbits observed in Newtonian fluids but the instantaneous rate of
rotation and trajectories of the orbits are modified. Qualitatively, shear
thinning has a similar effect to elongating the particle in a Newtonian fluid.
The period of rotation increases as the particle slows down more when aligned
with the flow due to a reduction of shear stresses. Unlike Jeffery orbits in
Newtonian fluids, in shear-thinning fluids the period of orbits depends on the
specific trajectory (or initial orientation of the particle).

They represent simple models for fluids with competing interactions that may
exhibit a rich micro and macroscopic phase behavior depending on both strength

the structural behavior near the liquid-vapor coexistence. Our findings

observed and could be understood as a frustration mechanism of the liquid-vapor

of non-rotating superfluid neutron stars in Newtonian physics. We use a simple
two-fluid model to describe the superfluid neutron star, where one fluid
consists of the superfluid neutrons,while the second fluid contains all the
comoving constituents (protons, electrons). The two fluids are assumed to be
""free"" in the sense of absence of vortex-mediated forces like mutual friction
or pinning, but they can be coupled by the equation of state, in particular by
entrainment.We calculate numerically the eigen-frequencies and -modes of
adiabatic oscillations, neglecting beta-reactions that would lead to
dissipation.We find a doubling of all acoustic-type modes (f-modes, p-modes),
and confirm the absence of g-modes in these superfluid models. We show
analytically and numerically that only in the case of non-stratified background
models (i.e. with no composition gradient) can these doublets of acoustic modes
be separated into two distinct families, which are characterised by either co-
or counter-moving fluids respectively, and which are sometimes referred to as
""ordinary"" and ""superfluid"" modes. In the general, stratified case, however,
this separation is not possible, and these acoustic modes can not be classified
as being either purely ""ordinary"" or ""superfluid"". We show how the properties
of the two-fluid modes change as functions of the coupling by entrainment. We
find avoided mode-crossings for the stratified models, while the crossings are
not avoided in the non-stratified, separable case. The oscillations of
normal-fluid neutron stars are recovered as a special case simply by locking
the two fluids together.In this effective one-fluid case we find the usual
singlet f- and p-modes, and we also find the expected g-modes.

granular matter poured into a silo. The experiments are conducted in two
regimes where: (i) the volume fraction of the fluid is small and it forms
liquid bridges between particles, and (ii) the particles are completely
immersed in the fluid. The data is obtained by imaging the pile formed inside a
quasi-two dimensional silo through the transparent glass side walls. In the
first series of experiments, the angle of repose is observed to increase
sharply with the volume fraction of the fluid and then saturates at a value
that depends on the size of the particles. We systematically study the effect
of viscosity by using water-glycerol mixtures to vary it over at least three
orders of magnitude while keeping the surface tension almost constant. Besides
surface tension, the viscosity of the fluid is observed to have an effect on
the angle of repose and the extent of segregation. In case of bidisperse

on the size ratio of the particles and the viscosity of the fluid. The sharp
initial change and the subsequent saturation in the extent of segregation and

fluid mixture are derived using a functional Taylor expansion of the free
energy around an inhomogeneous equilibrium distribution. The system of
equations is closed by the introduction of a reference functional for the
correlations beyond second order in the density difference from the equilibrium
distribution. Explicit expressions are obtained for energies required to insert
particles of the fluid mixture into the inhomogeneous system. The approach is
illustrated by the determination of the equation of state of a simple,
truncated Lennard--Jones fluid and the analysis of the behavior of this fluid
near a hard wall. The wall--fluid integral equation exhibits complete drying
and the corresponding coexisting densities are in good agreement with those
obtained from the standard (Maxwell) construction applied to the bulk fluid.
Self--consistency of the approach is examined by analyzing the
virial/compressibility routes to the equation of state and the Gibbs--Duhem
relation for the bulk fluid, and the contact density sum rule and the Gibbs
adsorption equation for the hard wall problem. For the bulk fluid, we find good
self--consistency for stable states outside the critical region. For the hard
wall problem, the Gibbs adsorption equation is fulfilled very well near phase
coexistence where the adsorption is large.For the contact density sum rule, we
find some deviationsnear coexistence due to a slight disagreement between the

motion and arbitrary transverse expansion. Relaxation equations for the shear
stress tensor components, derived from the phenomenological Israel-Stewart's
theory of dissipative relativistic fluid, are solved simultaneously with the
energy-momentum conservation equations. Comparison of evolution of ideal and
viscous fluid, both initialized under the similar conditions, e.g. same
equilibration time, energy density and velocity profile, indicate that in
viscous fluid, energy density or temperature of the fluid evolve slowly than in
an ideal fluid. Transverse expansion is also more in viscous evolution. We have
also studied particle production in viscous dynamics. Compared to ideal
dynamics, in viscous dynamics, particle yield at high $p_T$ is increased.
Elliptic flow on the other hand decreases. Minimally viscous QGP fluid,
initialized at entropy density $s_{ini}$=110 $fm^{-3}$ at the initial time

critical point inside a porous layer heated from below (Rayleigh-Darcy
convection) is studied. The fluid having the temperature slightly above the
critical one is one-component. The hydrodynamic model describing a high
compressible fluid phase at variable physical properties inside a solid matrix
at a uniform porosity is analyzed. A near-critical fluid is assumed to be the
van der Waals gas. In the limit of small variations in the density and
thermodynamic coefficients where the Oberbeck-Boussinesq approximation is
applicable, the correlation relations for the key criteria of similarity under
the stratification effect are obtained. These relations connect the model
parameters (the Rayleigh-Darcy and Prandtl numbers appearing in the
dimensionless governing equations) with the criteria of similarity (the real
Rayleigh-Darcy and Prandtl numbers characterizing convection actually).
Steady-state Rayleigh-Darcy convection near the stability threshold in
conditions of the Oberbeck-Boussinesq approximation to be valid is simulated
numerically. A set of solutions is analyzed with the use of the correlation
relations resulting in a universal dependency of the corrected Nusselt number
on the real Rayleigh-Darcy number described by a single curve. Convection of
near-critical fluid is compared with that of normal fluid. The temperature
difference at boundaries corresponding to the convection onset and depending on
the Schwarzschild and Rayleigh criteria is analyzed analytically. As obtained,
near the critical point, the threshold temperature difference at boundaries
becomes independent of solid matrix and is determined solely by the critical
adiabatic temperature gradient of fluid phase.

account for fluid-structure interactions through viscous drag terms to transfer
momentum from the fluid to immersed structures. In the inertial regime, this
coupling often introduces a prohibitively small time-scale into the temporal
dynamics of the fluid-structure system. This is further exacerbated in the
presence of thermal fluctuations. We discuss here a systematic reduction
technique for the full inertial equations to obtain a simplified description

various problems, from simple setups to cosmological simulations. The purpose
of tracer particles is to allow the flow to be followed in a Lagrangian way,
tracing the evolution of the fluid with time, and allowing the thermodynamical
history of individual fluid parcels to be recorded. We find that the
commonly-used `velocity field tracers', which are advected using the fluid
velocity field, do not in general follow the mass flow correctly, and explain
why this is the case. This method can result in orders-of-magnitude biases in
simulations of driven turbulence and in cosmological simulations, rendering the
velocity field tracers inappropriate for following these flows. We then discuss
a novel implementation of `Monte Carlo tracers', which are moved along with
fluid cells, and are exchanged probabilistically between them following the
mass flux. This method reproduces the mass distribution of the fluid correctly.
The main limitation of this approach is that it is more diffusive than the
fluid itself. Nonetheless, we show that this novel approach is more reliable
than what has been employed previously and demonstrate that it is appropriate
for following hydrodynamical flows in mesh-based codes. The Monte Carlo tracers
can also naturally be transferred between fluid cells and other types of
particles, such as stellar particles, so that the mass flow in cosmological

pressure data, is governed by the 2D Navier-Stokes equations for an
incompressible, viscous fluid, defined on a 2D cylinder. The elastodynamics of
the cylinder wall is governed by the 1D linear wave equation modeling the thin
structural layer, and by the 2D equations of linear elasticity modeling the
thick structural layer. The fluid and the structure, as well as the two
structural layers, are fully coupled via the kinematic and dynamic coupling
conditions describing continuity of velocity and balance of contact forces. The
thin structural layer acts as a fluid-structure interface with mass. The
resulting FSI problem is a nonlinear moving boundary problem of

one-fluid dusty gas algorithm using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). The
algorithm preserves the conservation properties of the SPH formalism. In
particular, the total gas and dust mass, momentum, angular momentum and energy
are all exactly conserved. Shock viscosity and conductivity terms are
generalised to handle the two-phase mixture accordingly. The algorithm is
benchmarked against a comprehensive suit of problems: dustybox, dustywave,
dustyshock and dustyoscill, each of them addressing different properties of the
method. We compare the performance of the one-fluid algorithm to the standard
two-fluid approach. The one-fluid algorithm is found to solve both of the
fundamental limitations of the two- fluid algorithm: it is no longer possible
to concentrate dust below the resolution of the gas (they have the same
resolution by definition), and the spatial resolution criterion h < csts,
required in two-fluid codes to avoid over-damping of kinetic energy, is
unnecessary. Implicit time stepping is straightforward. As a result, the
algorithm is up to ten billion times more efficient for 3D simulations of small
grains. Additional benefits include the use of half as many particles, a single
kernel and fewer SPH interpolations. The only limitation is that it does not
capture multi-streaming of dust in the limit of zero coupling, suggesting that

  Low-Mach number",http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.0481v2,"['Francesco Battista', 'Francesco Picano', 'Carlo Massimo Casciola']","  Supercritical fluids near the critical point are characterized by liquid-like
densities and gas-like transport properties. These features are purposely
exploited in different contexts ranging from natural products
extraction/fractionation to aerospace propulsion. Large part of studies
concerns this last context, focusing on the dynamics of supercritical fluids at
high Mach number where compressibility and thermodynamics strictly interact.
Despite the widespread use also at low Mach number, the turbulent mixing
properties of slightly supercritical fluids have still not investigated in
detail in this regime. This topic is addressed here by dealing with Direct
Numerical Simulations (DNS) of a coaxial jet of a slightly supercritical Van
der Waals fluid. Since acoustic effects are irrelevant in the Low Mach number
conditions found in many industrial applications, the numerical model is based
on a suitable low-Mach number expansion of the governing equation. According to
experimental observations, the weakly supercritical regime is characterized by
the formation of finger-like structures-- the so-called ligaments --in the
shear layers separating the two streams. The mechanism of ligament formation at
vanishing Mach number is extracted from the simulations and a detailed
statistical characterization is provided. Ligaments always form whenever a high
density contrast occurs, independently of real or perfect gas behaviors. The
difference between real and perfect gas conditions is found in the ligament
small-scale structure. More intense density gradients and thinner interfaces
characterize the near critical fluid in comparison with the smoother behavior
of the perfect gas. A phenomenological interpretation is here provided on the
basis of the real gas thermodynamics properties.

Firstly, numerical simulation of natural convection in a two-dimensional square

Inflation in a viscous fluid model,http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.05451v2,"['Kazuharu Bamba', 'Sergei D. Odintsov']","  We explore a fluid description of the inflationary universe. In particular,
we investigate a fluid model in which the equation of state (EoS) for a fluid
includes bulk viscosity. We find that the three observables of inflationary
cosmology: the spectral index of the curvature perturbations, the
tensor-to-scalar ratio of the density perturbations, and the running of the
spectral index, can be consistent with the recent Planck results. We also
reconstruct the explicit EoS for a fluid from the spectral index of the
curvature perturbations compatible with the Planck analysis. In the
reconstructed models of a fluid, the tensor-to-scalar ratio of the density
perturbations can satisfy the constraints obtained from the Planck satellite.
The running of the spectral index can explain the Planck data. In addition, it
is demonstrated that in the reconstructed models of a fluid, the graceful exit
from inflation can be realized. Moreover, we show that the singular inflation
can occur in a fluid model. Furthermore, we show that a fluid description of
inflation can be equivalent to the description of inflation in terms of scalar

sedimentation of circular particles in two-dimensional channel filled with a
viscoelastic fluid of FENE-CR type, which is generalized from a
domain/distributed Lagrange multiplier method with a factorization approach for
Oldroyd-B fluids developed in [J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 156 (2009) 95].
Numerical results suggest that the polymer extension limit L for the FENE-CR
fluid has no effect on the final formation of vertical chain for the cases of
two disks and three disks in two-dimensional narrow channel, at least for the
values of L considered in this article; but the intermediate dynamics of
particle interaction before having a vertical chain can be different for the
smaller values of L when increasing the relaxation time. For the cases of six
particles sedimenting in FENE-CR type viscoelastic fluid, the formation of
chain of 4 to 6 disks does depend on the polymer extension limit L. For the
smaller values of L, FENE-CR type viscoelastic fluid can not bring them
together like the case of these particles settling in a vertical chain
formation in Oldroyd-B fluid; but two separated chains of three disks are
formed. Similar results for the case of ten disks are also obtained. The
numerical results of several more particle cases suggest that for smaller

flows of viscoelastic fluids has provided useful insights into the mechanisms
that may govern the initial stages of transition to elastic turbulence.
However, distributed body forces are not easy to implement in experiments and
so there is a need to examine amplification of localized body forces. In this
work, we use the linearized governing equations to examine such amplification
in Poiseuille flow of FENE-CR fluids. We first identify the wall-normal
location at which the impulsive excitations experience the largest
amplification and then analyze the kinetic energy of the fluctuations and the
resulting flow structures. For both a Newtonian fluid at high Reynolds numbers
and a viscoelastic fluid at low Reynolds numbers, the largest amplification
occurs for disturbances that are located near the channel wall. Our analysis of
the energy evolution shows that a localized body force in the spanwise
direction has the largest impact and that the streamwise velocity component is
most affected. For viscoelastic fluids we observe the development of vortical
structures away from the source of impulsive excitation. This feature is less
prominent in Newtonian fluids and it may provide a mechanism for triggering the
initial stages of transition to elastic turbulence.

Hydrodynamic instabilities in miscible fluids,http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07521v1,"['Domenico Truzzolillo', 'Luca Cipelletti']","  Hydrodynamic instabilities in miscible fluids are ubiquitous, from natural
phenomena up to geological scales, to industrial and technological
applications, where they represent the only way to control and promote mixing
at low Reynolds numbers, well below the transition from laminar to turbulent
flow. As for immiscible fluids, the onset of hydrodynamic instabilities in
miscible fluids is directly related to the physics of their interfaces. The
focus of this review is therefore on the general mechanisms driving the growth
of disturbances at the boundary between miscible fluids, under a variety of
forcing conditions. In the absence of a regularizing mechanism, these
disturbances would grow indefinitely. For immiscible fluids, interfacial
tension provides such a regularizing mechanism, because of the energy cost
associated to the creation of new interface by a growing disturbance. For
miscible fluids, however, the very existence of interfacial stresses that mimic
an effective surface tension is debated. Other mechanisms, however, may also be
relevant, such as viscous dissipation. We shall review the stabilizing
mechanisms that control the most common hydrodynamic instabilities,
highlighting those cases for which the lack of an effective interfacial tension
poses deep conceptual problems in the mathematical formulation of a linear
stability analysis. Finally, we provide a short overview on the ongoing
research on the effective, out of equilibrium interfacial tension between
miscible fluids.

Self-diffusiophoresis induced by fluid interfaces,http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06346v1,"['P. Malgaretti', 'M. N. Popescu', 'S. Dietrich']","  The influence of a fluid-fluid interface on self-phoresis of chemically
active, axially symmetric, spherical colloids is analyzed. Distinct from the
studies of self-phoresis for colloids trapped at fluid interfaces or in the
vicinity of hard walls, here we focus on the issue of self-phoresis close to a
fluid-fluid interface. In order to provide physically intuitive results
highlighting the role played by the interface, the analysis is carried out for
the case that the symmetry axis of the colloid is normal to the interface;
moreover, thermal fluctuations are not taken into account. Similarly to what
has been observed near hard walls, we find that such colloids can be set into
motion even if their whole surface is homogeneously active. This is due to the
anisotropy along the direction normal to the interface owing to the
partitioning by diffusion, among the coexisting fluid phases, of the product of
the chemical reaction taking place at the colloid surface. Different from
results corresponding to hard walls, in the case of a fluid interface the
direction of motion, i.e., towards the interface or away from it, can be
controlled by tuning the physical properties of one of the two fluid phases.
This effect is analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively, both by resorting to
a far-field approximation and via an exact, analytical calculation which
provides the means for a critical assessment of the approximate analysis.

A Phase-Field Model for Fluid-Structure-Interaction,http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02354v2,"['Dominic Mokbel', 'Helmut Abels', 'Sebastian Aland']","  In this paper, we develop a novel phase-field model for fluid-structure
interaction (FSI), that is capable to handle very large deformations as well as
topology changes like contact of the solid to the domain boundary. The model is
based on a fully Eulerian description of the velocity field in both, the fluid
and the elastic domain. Viscous and elastic stresses in the Navier-Stokes
equations are restricted to the corresponding domains by multiplication with
their characteristic functions. To obtain the elastic stress, an additional
Oldroyd-B - like equation is solved. Thermodynamically consistent forces are
derived by energy variation. The convergence of the derived equations to the
traditional sharp interface formulation of fluid-structure interaction is shown
by matched asymptotic analysis. The model is evaluated in a challenging
benchmark scenario of an elastic body traversing a fluid channel. A comparison
to reference values from Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) simulations shows
very good agreement. We highlight some distinct advantages of the new model,
like the avoidance of re-triangulations and the stable inclusion of surface
tension. Further, we demonstrate how simple it is to include contact dynamics
into the model, by simulating a ball bouncing off a wall. We extend this
scenario to include adhesion of the ball, which to our knowledge, cannot be
simulated with any other FSI model. While we have restricted simulations to
fluid-structure interaction, the model is capable to simulate any combination
of viscous fluids, visco-elastic fluids and elastic solids.

"Dynamics of hydrodynamically coupled Brownian harmonic oscillators in a
  Maxwell fluid",http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06147v1,['Shuvojit Paul'],"  Recently, many interesting features of the hydrodynamically coupled motions
of the Brownian particles in a viscous fluid have been reported which are
impossible for the uncoupled motions of the similar particles. However, it is
expected that those physics in a viscoelastic fluid is much more interesting
due to the presence of the additional frequency dependent elasticity of the
medium. Thus, a theory describing the equilibrium dynamics of two
hydrodynamically coupled Brownian harmonic oscillators in a viscoelastic
Maxwell fluid has been derived which appears with new and impressive aspects.
Initially, the response functions have been calculated and then the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem has been used to calculate the correlation
functions between the coloured noises present on the concerned particles placed
in a Maxwell fluid due to the thermal motions of the fluid molecules. These
correlation functions appear to be in a linear relationship with the
delta-correlated noises in a viscous fluid. Consequently, this reduces the
statistical description of a simple viscoelastic fluid to the statistical
representation for an extended dynamical system subjected to delta-correlated
random forces. Thereupon, the auto and cross-correlation functions in the time
domain and frequency domain and the mean-square displacement functions of the
particles have been calculated which are perfectly consistent with their
corresponding established forms in a viscous fluid and emerge with exceptional
characteristics.

of the fluid hierarchy, where the gyrotropic heat flux fluctuations or the

lower-order fluid moments. To obtain a closure of a fluid model expanded around
a bi-Maxwellian distribution function, the usual plasma dispersion function
$Z(\zeta)$ that appears in kinetic theory or the associated plasma response
function $R(\zeta)=1 + \zeta Z(\zeta)$, have to be approximated with a suitable
Pad\'e approximant in such a way, that the closure is valid for all $\zeta$
values. Such closures are rare, and the original closures of Hammett and
Perkins are often employed. Here we present a complete mapping of all plausible
Landau fluid closures that can be constructed at the level of 4th-order moments
in the gyrotropic limit and we identify the most precise closures. Furthermore,
by considering 1D closures at higher-order moments, we show that it is possible
to reproduce linear Landau damping in the fluid framework to any desired
precision, thus showing convergence of the fluid and collisionless kinetic

we follow a nonlinear Onsager formalism according to which the dynamics
minimize a Rayleighian functional where dissipation, power input and energy
release rate compete. Finally, we propose new computational methods, which
build on Onsager's formalism and our ALE formulation, to deal with the
resulting stiff system of higher-order of partial differential equations. We

Dissipative hydrodynamics in 2+1 dimension,http://arxiv.org/abs/nucl-th/0604014v2,['A. K. Chaudhuri'],"  In 2+1 dimension, we have simulated the hydrodynamic evolution of QGP fluid
with dissipation due to shear viscosity. Comparison of evolution of ideal and
viscous fluid, both initialised under the same conditions e.g. same
equilibration time, energy density and velocity profile, reveal that the
dissipative fluid evolves slowly, cooling at a slower rate. Cooling get still
slower for higher viscosity. The fluid velocities on the otherhand evolve
faster in a dissipative fluid than in an ideal fluid. The transverse expansion
is also enhanced in dissipative evolution. For the same decoupling temperature,
freeze-out surface for a dissipative fluid is more extended than an ideal
fluid. Dissipation produces entropy as a result of which particle production is
increased. Particle production is increased due to (i) extension of the
freeze-out surface and (ii) change of the equilibrium distribution function to
a non-equilibrium one, the last effect being prominent at large transverse
momentum. Compared to ideal fluid, transverse momentum distribution of pion
production is considerably enhanced. Enhancement is more at high $p_T$ than at
low $p_T$. Pion production also increases with viscosity, larger the viscosity,
more is the pion production. Dissipation also modifies the elliptic flow.
Elliptic flow is reduced in viscous dynamics. Also, contrary to ideal dynamics
where elliptic flow continues to increase with transverse momentum, in viscous
dynamics, elliptic flow tends to saturate at large transverse momentum. The
analysis suggest that initial conditions of the hot, dense matter produced in
Au+Au collisions at RHIC, as extracted from ideal fluid analysis can be changed
significantly if the QGP fluid is viscous.

be used to model the flow of the synovial fluid. The actual geometry where the
flow of the synovial fluid takes place is very complicated, and therefore the
governing equations are not amenable to simple mathematical analysis. In order
to understand the response of the model, we choose to study the flow in a
simple geometry. While the flow domain is not a geometry relevant to the flow
of the synovial fluid in the human body it yet provides a flow which can be
used to assess the efficacy of different models that have been proposed to
describe synovial fluids. We study the flow in the annular region between two
cylinders, one of which is undergoing unsteady oscillations about their common
axis, in order to understand the quintessential behavioral characteristics of
the synovial fluid. We use the three models suggested by Hron et al. [ J. Hron,

Generalized fluid theory including non-Maxwellian kinetic effects,http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09599v1,['Olivier Izacard'],"  The results obtained by the plasma physics community for the validation and
the prediction of turbulence and transport in magnetized plasma come mainly
from the use of very CPU-consuming particle-in-cell or (gyro)kinetic codes
which naturally include non-Maxwellian kinetic effects. To date, fluid codes
are not considered to be relevant for the description of these kinetic effects.
Here, after revisiting the limitations of the current fluid theory developed in
the 19th century, we generalize the fluid theory including kinetic effects such
as non-Maxwellian super-thermal tails with as few fluid equations as possible.
The collisionless and collisional fluid closures from the nonlinear Landau
Fokker-Planck collision operator are shown for an arbitrary collisionality.
Indeed, the first fluid models associated with two examples of collisionless
fluid closures are obtained by assuming an analytic non-Maxwellian distribution
function (e.g., the INMDF [O. Izacard, Phys. Plasmas 23, 082504 (2016)]). One
of the main differences with the literature is our analytic representation of
the distribution function in the velocity phase space with as few hidden
variables as possible thanks to the use of non-orthogonal basis sets. These new
non-Maxwellian fluid equations could initiate the next generation of fluid
codes including kinetic effects and can be expanded to other scientific
disciplines such as astrophysics, condensed matter, or hydrodynamics. As a
validation test, we perform a numerical simulation based on a minimal reduced
INMDF fluid model. The result of this test is the discovery of the origin of
particle and heat diffusion. The diffusion is due to the competition between a
growing INMDF on short time scales due to spatial gradients and the
thermalization on longer time scales. The results shown here could draw the
breaking of some unsolved understandings of the turbulence.

self-diffusivity, viscosity, and entropy. Interestingly, interactions that
eliminate particle layering significantly reduce confined fluid mobility,
whereas those that enhance layering can have the opposite effect. Excess

coefficients of an uncharged fluid, following the procedure described in

uncharged fluid can have 15 transport coefficients at second order in

among these 15 coefficients. So finally the relativistic stress tensor of an
uncharged fluid can have 10 independent transport coefficients at second order.

different dependency from $m>1$. The effect of viscosity increases with an

Slowly rotating superfluid Newtonian neutron star model with entrainment,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0107176v1,"['R. Prix', 'G. L. Comer', 'N. Andersson']","  We develop a formalism to model slowly rotating superfluid Newtonian neutron
stars. A two-fluid model is used to describe the matter, where one fluid is the
superfluid neutrons that are believed to exist in the inner crust and core of
mature neutron stars, while the other fluid is a charge neutral conglomerate of
the remaining constituents (crust nuclei, core superconducting protons,
electrons, etc). We include the entrainment effect, which is a non-dissipative
interaction between the two fluids whereby a momentum induced in one of the
fluids will cause part of the mass of the other fluid to be carried along. The
equations that describe rotational equilibria (i.e. axisymmetric and stationary
configurations) are approximated using the slow-rotation approximation; an
expansion in terms of the rotation rates of the two fluids where only terms up
to second-order are kept. Our formalism allows the neutrons to rotate at a rate
different from that of the charged constituents. For a particular equation of
state that is quadratic in the two mass-densities and relative velocities of
the fluids, we find an analytic solution to the slow-rotation equations. This
result provides an elegant generalisation to the two-fluid problem of the
standard expressions for the one-fluid polytrope ${\cal E} \propto \rho^2$. The
model equation of state includes entrainment and is general enough to allow for
realistic values for, say, mass and radius of the star. It also includes a term
that can be related to ``symmetry energy'' terms that appear in more realistic
equations of state. We use the analytic solution to explore how relative
rotation between the two fluids, the ``symmetry energy'' term, and entrainment
affect the neutron star's local distribution of particles, as well as global
quantities as the Kepler limit, ellipticity, and moments of inertia.

Trapped fluid in contact interface,http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03954v2,"['Andrei G. Shvarts', 'Vladislav A. Yastrebov']","  We study the mechanical contact between a deformable body with a wavy surface
and a rigid flat taking into account pressurized fluid trapped in the
interface. A finite element model is formulated for a general problem of
trapped fluid for frictionless and frictional contact. Using this model we
investigate the evolution of the real contact area, maximal frictional traction
and global coefficient of friction under increasing external pressure. Elastic
and elasto-plastic material models, compressible and incompressible fluid
models and different geometrical characteristics of the wavy surface are used.
We show that in case of incompressible fluid, due to its pressurization, the
real contact area and the global coefficient of friction decrease monotonically
with the increasing external pressure. Ultimately the contact opens and the
fluid occupies the entire interface resulting in vanishing of static friction.
In case of compressible fluids with pressure-dependent bulk modulus, we
demonstrate a non-monotonous behaviour of the global coefficient of friction
due to a competition between non-linear evolution of the contact area and of
the fluid pressure. However, for realistic compressibility of solids and
fluids, contact-opening cannot be reached at realistic pressures. An asymptotic
analytical result for the trap-opening pressure is found and shown to be
independent of the surface slope if it is small. On the other hand, in case of
elastic-perfectly plastic materials, we again observe fluid permeation into the
contact interface. Finally, we study the distribution of frictional tractions
during the depletion of the contact area under increasing pressure. This
process leads to emergence of singularity-like peaks in the tangential
tractions (bounded by the Coulomb's limit) near the contact edges. We point out
the similarity between the processes of trap opening and interfacial crack...

for incompressible fluid flow simulations to viscoplastic fluids. The system is
governed by incompressible conservation of mass, the Cauchy momentum equation
and a generalised Newtonian constitutive law. In order to simulate a wide range
of viscoplastic fluids, we employ the Herschel-Bulkley model for yield-stress
fluids with nonlinear stress-strain dependency above the yield limit. We
utilise Papanastasiou regularisation in our algorithm to deal with the
singularity in apparent viscosity. The resulting system of partial differential
equations is solved using the IAMR code (Incompressible Adaptive Mesh
Refinement), which uses second-order Godunov methodology for the advective

power-law fluids in the two-dimensional lid-driven cavity. In doing so, we
expand the range of Bingham and Reynolds numbers which have been considered in

  Eulerian-ALE fluid domain decomposition involving cut elements",http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00343v1,"['Benedikt Schott', 'Christoph Ager', 'Wolfgang A. Wall']","  A novel method for complex fluid-structure interaction (FSI) involving large
structural deformation and motion is proposed. The new approach is based on a
hybrid fluid formulation that combines the advantages of purely Eulerian
(fixed-grid) and Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE moving mesh) formulations
in the context of FSI. The structure - as commonly given in Lagrangian
description - is surrounded by a fine resolved layer of fluid elements based on
an ALE-framework. This ALE-fluid patch, which is embedded in an Eulerian
background fluid domain, follows the deformation and motion of the structural
interface. This approximation technique is not limited to Finite Element
Methods, but can can also be realized within other frameworks like Finite
Volume or Discontinuous Galerkin Methods. In this work, the surface coupling
between the two disjoint fluid subdomains is imposed weakly using a stabilized
Nitsche's technique in a Cut Finite Element Method (CutFEM) framework. At the
fluid-solid interface, standard weak coupling of node-matching or non-matching
finite element approximations can be utilized. As the fluid subdomains can be
meshed independently, a sufficient mesh quality in the vicinity of the common
fluid-structure interface can be assured. To our knowledge the proposed method
is the only method (despite some overlapping domain decomposition approaches
that suffer from other issues) that allows for capturing boundary layers and
flow detachment via appropriate grids around largely moving and deforming
bodies and is able to do this e.g. without the necessity of costly remeshing
procedures. In addition it might also help to safe computational costs as now
background grids can be much coarser. Various FSI-cases of rising complexity
conclude the work.

Landau fluid closures. These closures were pioneered by Hammett and Perkins and
allow for the rigorous incorporation of collisionless Landau damping into a
fluid framework. It is Landau damping that sharply separates traditional fluid
models and collisionless kinetic theory, and is the main reason why the usual
fluid models do not converge to the kinetic description, even in the
long-wavelength low-frequency limit. We start with a brief introduction to
kinetic theory, where we discuss in detail the plasma dispersion function
$Z(\zeta)$, and the associated plasma response function $R(\zeta)=1+\zeta
Z(\zeta)=-Z'(\zeta)/2$. We then consider a 1D (electrostatic) geometry and make
a significant effort to map all possible Landau fluid closures that can be
constructed at the 4th-order moment level. These closures for parallel moments
have general validity from the largest astrophysical scales down to the Debye
length, and we verify their validity by considering examples of the (proton and
electron) Landau damping of the ion-acoustic mode, and the electron Landau
damping of the Langmuir mode. We proceed by considering 1D closures at
higher-order moments than the 4th-order, and as was concluded in Part 1, this
is not possible without Landau fluid closures. We show that it is possible to
reproduce linear Landau damping in the fluid framework to any desired
precision, thus showing the convergence of the fluid and collisionless kinetic
descriptions. We then consider a 3D (electromagnetic) geometry in the
gyrotropic (long-wavelength low-frequency) limit and map all closures that are
available at the 4th-order moment level. In the Appendix A, we provide

equilibrium in the framework of the two-fluid superfluid hydrodynamics and
Newtonian gravity. Our calculations focus on linear perturbations of background
equilibria in which the two fluids move together, the total density is uniform,
and the densities of the two components are proportional to one another, with
ratios that are independent of position. The motions of the two fluids are
coupled by mutual friction, as formulated by Khalatnikov. We show that there
are two general classes of modes for small perturbations: one class in which
the two fluids move together and the other in which there is relative motion
between them. The former are identical to the modes found for a single fluid,
except that the rate of viscous dissipation, when computed in the secular (or
``low Reynolds number'') approximation under the assumption of a constant
kinematic viscosity, is diminished by a factor $f_N$, the fraction of the total
mass in the normal fluid. The relative modes are completely new, and are
studied in detail for a range of values for the phenomenological mutual
friction coefficients, relative densities of the superfluid and normal
components, and, for Roche ellipsoids, binary mass ratios. We find that there
are no new secular instabilities connected with the relative motions of the two
fluid components. Moreover, although the new modes are subject to viscous
dissipation (a consequence of viscosity of the normal matter), they do not emit
gravitational radiation at all.

perfect fluid with spin known as the Weyssenhoff fluid. The possibility that
the dark energy may be described in part by the Weyssenhoff fluid is discussed.
The observational constraint coming from supernovae type Ia observations is
established. This result indicates that, whereas the cosmological constant is
still needed to explain current observations, the model with spin fluid is
admissible. For high redshifts $z > 1$ the differences between the model with
spin fluid and the cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant become
detectable observationally for the flat case with $\Omega_{\text{m},0}=0.3$.

granulation pattern in the solar photosphere by means of 3-dimensional
radiative hydrodynamics simulations. We used the MURaM code to obtain a
realistic model of the near-surface layers of the convection zone and the
photosphere. The pattern of horizontal temperature fluctuations at the base of
the photosphere consists of relatively hot granular cells bounded by the cooler
intergranular downflow network. With increasing height in the photosphere, the
amplitude of the temperature fluctuations diminishes. At a height of z=130-140
km in the photosphere, the pattern of horizontal temperature fluctuations
reverses so that granular regions become relatively cool compared to the
intergranular network. Detailed analysis of the trajectories of fluid elements
through the photosphere reveal that the motion of the fluid is non-adiabatic,
owing to strong radiative cooling when approaching the surface of optical depth
unity followed by reheating by the radiation field from below. The temperature
structure of the photosphere results from the competition between expansion of
rising fluid elements and radiative heating. The former acts to lower the
temperature of the fluid whereas the latter acts to increase it towards the
radiative equilibrium temperature with a net entropy gain. After the fluid
overturns and descends towards the convection zone, radiative energy loss again
decreases the entropy of the fluid. Radiative heating and cooling of fluid
elements that penetrate into the photosphere and overturn do not occur in equal
amounts. The imbalance in the cumulative heating and cooling of these fluid
elements is responsible for the reversal of temperature fluctuations with
respect to height in the photosphere.

the validation of the model in simple cases (Poiseuille flow, Darcy's law for
single component fluids), attention is focussed on the properties of binary
immiscible fluids in porous media. An extension of Darcy's law which explicitly
admits a viscous coupling between the fluids is verified, and evidence of
capillary effects are described. The influence of a third component, namely
surfactant, is studied in the same context. Invasion simulations have also been
performed. The effect of the applied force on the invasion process is reported.
As the forcing level increases, the invasion process becomes faster and the
residual oil saturation decreases. The introduction of surfactant in the
invading phase during imbibition produces new phenomena, including
emulsification and micellisation. At very low fluid forcing levels, this leads
to the production of a low-resistance gel, which then slows down the progress
of the invading fluid. At long times (beyond the water percolation threshold),
the concentration of remaining oil within the porous medium is lowered by the
action of surfactant, thus enhancing oil recovery. On the other hand, the
introduction of surfactant in the invading phase during drainage simulations
slows down the invasion process -- the invading fluid takes a more tortuous
path to invade the porous medium -- and reduces the oil recovery (the residual
oil saturation increases).

Thouless, Ao and Niu (TAN) and that of Iordanskii. In TAN no transverse force
on a vortex due to normal fluid flow was found, whereas the earlier work found
a transverse force proportional to normal fluid velocity u and normal fluid
density. We have linearized the time-independent two-fluid equations about the
exact solution for a vortex, and find three solutions which are important in
the region far from the vortex. Uniform superfluid flow gives rise to the usual
superfluid Magnus force. Uniform normal fluid flow gives rise to no forces in
the linear region, but does not satisfy reasonable boundary conditions at short
distances. A logarithmically increasing normal fluid flow gives a viscous
force. As in classical hydrodynamics, and as in the early work of Hall and
Vinen, this logarithmic increase must be cut off by nonlinear effects at large
distances; this gives a viscous force proportional to u/ln(u), and a transverse
contribution which goes like u/(ln u)^2, even in the absence of an explicit
Iordanskii force. In the limit u goes to zero the TAN result is obtained, but
at nonzero u there are important corrections that were not found in TAN. We
argue that the Magnus force in a superfluid at nonzero temperature is an
example of a topological relation for which finite-size corrections may be
large.

fluid-fluid interactions we observe a crossover from behaviour characteristic
of the normal surface universality class, strong critical adsorption, to
behaviour characteristic of a 'neutral' wall. The crossover is reminiscent of
that which occurs near the ordinary surface transition in Ising films subject
to vanishing surface fields. For the 'neutral' wall the density profile, away

to an adsorption that is constant along the critical isochore. The same

the modification of the solid-fluid interaction leads to significant changes in

we find two distinct regimes as a function of the degree of wetting, with a
sharp transition between them. In the case of a highly-wetting suspending

in agreement with that obtained from the solution of the continuum Stokes

intricate dynamics than their ordinary fluid counterparts. Superfluidity allows
different superfluid (and superconducting) species of particles to have
independent fluid flows, a consequence of which is that the fluid equations of
motion contain as many fluid element velocities as superfluid species. Whenever
the particles of one superfluid interact with those of another, the momentum of
each superfluid will be a linear combination of both superfluid velocities.
This leads to the so-called entrainment effect whereby the motion of one
superfluid will induce a momentum in the other superfluid. We have constructed
a fully relativistic model for entrainment between superfluid neutrons and
superconducting protons using a relativistic $\sigma - \omega$ mean field model
for the nucleons and their interactions. In this context there are two notions
of ``relativistic'': relativistic motion of the individual nucleons with
respect to a local region of the star (i.e. a fluid element containing, say, an
Avogadro's number of particles), and the motion of fluid elements with respect
to the rest of the star. While it is the case that the fluid elements will
typically maintain average speeds at a fraction of that of light, the
supranuclear densities in the core of a neutron star can make the nucleons
themselves have quite high average speeds within each fluid element. The
formalism is applied to the problem of slowly-rotating superfluid neutron star
configurations, a distinguishing characteristic being that the neutrons can
rotate at a rate different from that of the protons.

Probabilistic Dynamics of Two-Layer Geophysical Flows,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0104143v1,"['Igor Chueshov', 'Jinqiao Duan', 'Bjorn Schmalfuss']","  The two-layer quasigeostrophic flow model is an intermidiate system between
the single-layer 2D barotropic flow model and the continuously stratified, 3D
baroclinic flow model. This model is widely used to investigate basic
mechanisms in geophysical flows, such as baroclinic effects, the Gulf Stream
and subtropical gyres. The wind forcing acts only on the top layer. We consider
the two-layer quasigeostrophic model under stochastic wind forcing. We first
transformed this system into a coupled system of random partial differential
equations and then show that the asymptotic probabilistic dynamics of this
system depends only on the top fluid layer. Namely, in the probability sense
and asymptotically, the dynamics of the two-layer quasigeostrophic fluid system
is determinied by the top fluid layer, or, the bottom fluid layer is slaved by
the top fluid layer.
  This conclusion is true provided that the Wiener process and the fluid
parameters satisfy a certain condition. In particular, this latter condition is
satisfied when the trace of the covariance operator of the Wiener process is
controled by a certain upper bound, and the Ekman constant $r$ is sufficiently
large. Note that the generalized time derivative of the Wiener process models
the fluctuating part of the wind stress forcing on the top fluid layer, and the
Ekman constant $r$ measures the rate for vorticity decay due to the friction in
the bottom Ekman layer.

  Systems, with Application to Newtonian Superfluid Neutron Stars",http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0509241v1,"['Nils Andersson', 'G. L. Comer']","  We develop a flux-conservative formalism for a Newtonian multi-fluid system,
including dissipation and entrainment (i.e. allowing the momentum of one fluid
to be a linear combination of the velocities of all fluids). Maximum use is
made of mass, energy, and linear and angular momentum conservation to specify
the equations of motion. Also used extensively are insights gleaned from a
convective variational action principle, key being the distinction between each
velocity and its canonically conjugate momentum. Dissipation is incorporated to
second order in the ``thermodynamic forces'' via the approach pioneered by
Onsager. An immediate goal of the investigation is to understand better the
number, and form, of independent dissipation terms required for a consistent
set of equations of motion in the multi-fluid context. A significant, but
seemingly innocuous detail, is that one must be careful to isolate ``forces''
that can be written as total gradients, otherwise errors can be made in
relating the net internal force to the net externally applied force. Our
long-range aim is to provide a formalism that can be used to model dynamical
multi-fluid systems both perturbatively and via fully nonlinear 3D numerical
evolutions. To elucidate the formalism we consider the standard model for a
heat-conducting, superfluid neutron star, which is believed to be dominated by
superfluid neutrons, superconducting protons, and a highly degenerate,
ultra-relativistic gas of normal fluid electrons. We determine that in this

molecular dynamics simulations to generate precise thermodynamic and kinetic
data for the equilibrium hard-sphere fluid confined between smooth hard walls.
These simulations show that the pronounced inhomogeneous structuring of the
fluid normal to the confining walls, often the primary focus of density
functional theory studies, has a negligible effect on many of its average
properties over a surprisingly broad range of conditions. We present one
consequence of this insensitivity to confinement: a simple analytical equation
relating the average density of the confined fluid to that of the bulk fluid
with equal activity. Nontrivial implications of confinement for average fluid
properties do emerge in this system, but only when the fluid is both (i) dense
and (ii) confined to a gap smaller than approximately three particle diameters.
For this limited set of conditions, we find that ""in-phase"" oscillatory
deviations in excess entropy and self-diffusivity (relative to the behavior of
the bulk fluid at the same average density) occur as a function of gap size.
These paired thermodynamic/kinetic deviations from bulk behavior appear to
reflect the geometric packing frustration that arises when the confined space
cannot naturally accommodate an integer number of particle layers.

important for planning technological experiments in space. Control and

liquid response to the vibrations. With this aim the theoretical investigation
for infinite plane and cylindrical fluid layers are performed. We investigated

steady modes of thermal vibrational convection are subjected to various
bifurcations. Bifurcations cause sharp changes in heat transfer. The Lorenz
model is generalized (GLM) and used to conduct the analysis of bifurcations
caused by the changing of the cavity shape and vibrational Rayleigh number. The
shape of steady-state surface in 3D space of the streamfunction of mean flow,
vibrational Rayleigh number and the cavity curvature is found. The numerical 2D
solution is performed for plane and cylindrical fluid layers. The results of

Flapping motion and force generation in a viscoelastic fluid,http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.0867v1,"['Thibaud Normand', 'Eric Lauga']","  In a variety of biological situations, swimming cells have to move through
complex fluids. Similarly, mucociliary clearance involves the transport of
polymeric fluids by beating cilia. Here, we consider the extent to which
complex fluids could be exploited for force generation on small scales. We
consider a prototypical reciprocal motion (i.e. identical under time-reversal
symmetry): The periodic flapping of a tethered semi-infinite plane. In the
Newtonian limit, such motion cannot be used for force generation according to
Purcell's scallop theorem. In a polymeric fluid (Oldroyd-B, and its
generalization), we show that this is not the case and calculate explicitly the
forces on the flapper for small-amplitude sinusoidal motion. Three setups are
considered: a flapper near a wall, a flapper in a wedge, and a two-dimensional
scallop-like flapper. In all cases, we show that at quadratic order in the
oscillation amplitude, the tethered flapping motion induces net forces but no
average flow. Our results demonstrate therefore that the scallop theorem is not
valid in polymeric fluids. The reciprocal component of the movement of
biological appendages such as cilia can thus generate nontrivial forces in
polymeric fluid such as mucus, and normal-stress differences can be exploited
as a pure viscoelastic force generation and propulsion method.

Multiple Resonances in Fluid-Loaded Vibrating Structures,http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.1653v1,['Pierre-Olivier Mattei'],"  This study deals with vibroacoustics under heavy fluid loading conditions.
Considerable attention has been and remains focused on this subject not only
because industry is very concerned but also because of mathematical
difficulties that make the numerical resolution of the problem very difficult.
It was recently observed in a numerical study on a high order perturbation
method under heavy fluid loading that a loaded vibrating plate results in a
frequency shift of the in vacuo single resonance (in both the real part because
of the fluid added mass and the imaginary part because of energy lost by
radiation into the fluid) as well as increase in the number of the resonance
frequencies : as a result of the loading, each single in vacuo resonance
frequency of the structure is transformed into a multiple resonance frequency.
Here we show that this phenomenon is said to be an extension to the heavy
loading condition of the Sanchez's classical result that have established that
in the case of a light loading conditions ""the scattering frequencies of a
fluid loaded elastic structure (ie the resonance frequencies) are nearly the
real eigenfrequencies of the elastic body alone and the complex scattering
frequencies of the fluid with a rigid solid"". Using classical results in the
framework of the theory of entire functions, it is established that a single
resonance of a simply supported fluid loaded rectangular plate is transformed
into an infinite number of resonances.

of Oldroyd-B fluids is studied from an input-output point of view by analyzing
the responses of the velocity components to spatio-temporal body forces. These
inputs into the governing equations are assumed to be harmonic in the spanwise
direction and stochastic in the wall-normal direction and in time. An explicit
Reynolds number scaling of frequency responses from different forcing to
different velocity components is developed, showing the same $Re$-dependence as
in Newtonian fluids. It is found that some of the frequency response components
peak at non-zero temporal frequencies. This is in contrast to Newtonian fluids,
where peaks are always observed at zero frequency, suggesting that viscoelastic
effects introduce additional timescales and promote development of flow
patterns with smaller time constants than in Newtonian fluids. The temporal
frequencies, corresponding to the peaks in the components of frequency
response, decrease with an increase in viscosity ratio (ratio of solvent
viscosity to total viscosity) and show maxima for non-zero elasticity number.
Our analysis of the Reynolds-Orr equation demonstrates that the energy-exchange
term involving the streamwise/wall-normal polymer stress component $\tau_{xy}$
and the wall-normal gradient of the streamwise velocity $\partial_y u$ becomes
increasingly important relative to the Reynolds stress term as the elasticity
number increases, and is thus the main driving force for amplification in flows
with strong viscoelastic effects.

a nanoscopic slit-pore. The simulations are carried out under isothermal
conditions in a specialized isostress ensemble in which N fluid molecules are
exposed to a compressional stress acting on the fluid in directions parallel
with the substrate planes. Fluid-fluid and fluid-substrate interactions are
modelled as in our previous work [M. Greschek et al., Soft Matter, 2010,
DOI:10.1039/B924417D). We study several anchoring mechanisms at the solid
substrate by introducing an anchoring function (0<g(u)<1) that depends on the
orientation of a fluid molecule relative to the substrate plane; g(u)
""switches"" the fluid-substrate attraction on or off. Here we focus on various
heterogeneous (i.e., hybrid) anchoring scenarios imposing different anchoring
functions at the opposite substrates. As in our previous study we compute the
isostress heat capacity which allows us to identify states at which the
confined fluid undergoes a structural transformation. The isotropic-nematic
transformation turns out to be nearly independent of the specific anchoring
scenario. This is because the director in the nematic phase assumes a direction
that is a compromise between the directions enforced by the competing anchoring
scenarios at either substrate. On the contrary, at lower compressional stresses
molecules prealign in specific directions that depend on details of the
anchoring scenario.

Big Bang nucleosynthesis with a stiff fluid,http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4166v3,"['Sourish Dutta', 'Robert J. Scherrer']","  Models that lead to a cosmological stiff fluid component, with a density
$\rho_S$ that scales as $a^{-6}$, where $a$ is the scale factor, have been
proposed recently in a variety of contexts. We calculate numerically the effect
of such a stiff fluid on the primordial element abundances. Because the stiff
fluid energy density decreases with the scale factor more rapidly than
radiation, it produces a relatively larger change in the primordial helium-4
abundance than in the other element abundances, relative to the changes
produced by an additional radiation component. We show that the helium-4
abundance varies linearly with the density of the stiff fluid at a fixed
fiducial temperature. Taking $\rho_{S10}$ and $\rho_{R10}$ to be the stiff
fluid energy density and the standard density in relativistic particles,
respectively, at $T = 10$ MeV, we find that the change in the primordial helium
abundance is well-fit by $\Delta Y_p = 0.00024(\rho_{S10}/\rho_{R10})$. The
changes in the helium-4 abundance produced by additional radiation or by a
stiff fluid are identical when these two components have equal density at a
""pivot temperature"", $T_*$, where we find $T_* = 0.55$ MeV. Current estimates
of the primordial $^4$He abundance give the constraint on a stiff fluid energy

weakly attractive smooth surfaces is investigated using molecular dynamics
simulations. In agreement with our previous studies on slip flow of
shear-thinning fluids, it is shown that the slip length passes through a local
minimum at low shear rates and then increases rapidly at higher shear rates. We
found that at sufficiently high shear rates, the slip flow over atomically flat
crystalline surfaces is anisotropic. It is demonstrated numerically that the
friction coefficient at the liquid-solid interface (the ratio of viscosity and
slip length) undergoes a transition from a constant value to the power-law
decay as a function of the slip velocity. The characteristic velocity of the
transition correlates well with the diffusion velocity of fluid monomers in the
first fluid layer near the solid wall at equilibrium. We also show that in the
linear regime, the friction coefficient is well described by a function of a
single variable, which is a product of the magnitude of surface-induced peak in
the structure factor and the contact density of the adjacent fluid layer. The
universal relationship between the friction coefficient and induced fluid
structure holds for a number of material parameters of the interface: fluid
density, chain length, wall-fluid interaction energy, wall density, lattice
type and orientation, thermal or solid walls.

by the geometric formulation of fluid dynamics, which views solutions to the
governing equations for perfect fluid flow as geodesics on the group of
volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of the fluid domain. Inspired by this
framework, we construct a finite-dimensional approximation to the
diffeomorphism group and its Lie algebra, thereby permitting a variational
temporal discretization of geodesics on the spatially discretized
diffeomorphism group. The extension to MHD and complex fluid flow is then made
through an appeal to the theory of Euler-Poincar\'{e} systems with advection,
which provides a generalization of the variational formulation of ideal fluid
flow to fluids with one or more advected parameters. Upon deriving a family of
structured integrators for these systems, we test their performance via a
numerical implementation of the update schemes on a cartesian grid. Among the
hallmarks of these new numerical methods are exact preservation of momenta
arising from symmetries, automatic satisfaction of solenoidal constraints on
vector fields, good long-term energy behavior, robustness with respect to the

Relativistic fluid dynamics in heavy ion collisions,http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.5828v1,['Shi Pu'],"  This dissertation is about the study of three important issues in the theory
of relativistic fluid dynamics: the stability of dissipative fluid dynamics,
the shear viscosity, and fluid dynamics with triangle anomaly.(1)The second
order theory of fluid dynamics is necessary for causality. However the
causality cannot be guaranteed for all parameters. The constraints for
parameters are then given. We also point out that the causality and the
stability are inter-correlated. It is found that a causal system must be
stable, but an acausal system in the boost frame at high speed must be
unstable. (2)The transport coefficients can be determined in kinetic theory. We
will firstly discuss about derivation of the shear viscosity via variational
method in the Boltzmann equation. Secondly, we will compute the shear viscosity
via AdS/CFT duality in a Bjorken boost invariant fluid with radial flow. It is
found that the ratio of the shear viscosity to entropy density is consistent
with the work of Policastro, Son and Starinets. As another application of
AdS/CFT duality, we also investigate the property of baryons in the strongly
coupled plasma. (3)As the last topic, we investigate the fluid dynamics with
quantum triangle anomalies. Recently it is pointed out that the vorticity has
to be introduced to relativistic fluid dynamics with anomalies to satisfy the
second law of thermodynamics. These new terms are also relevant to the Chiral
Magnetic Effect. We find such terms can be derived from the kinetic approach.

"Peristaltic Transport of a Rheological Fluid: Model for Movement of Food
  Bolus Through Esophagus",http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.6076v1,"['J. C. Misra', 'S. Maiti']","  Fluid mechanical peristaltic transport through esophagus has been of concern
in the paper. A mathematical model has been developed with an aim to study the
peristaltic transport of a rheological fluid for arbitrary wave shapes and tube
lengths. The Ostwald-de Waele power law of viscous fluid is considered here to
depict the non-Newtonian behaviour of the fluid. The model is formulated and
analyzed with the specific aim of exploring some important information
concerning the movement of food bolus through the esophagus. The analysis has
been carried out by using lubrication theory. The study is particularly
suitable for cases where the Reynolds number is small. The esophagus is treated
as a circular tube through which the transport of food bolus takes places by
periodic contraction of the esophageal wall. Variation of different variables
concerned with the transport phenomena such as pressure, flow velocity,
particle trajectory and reflux are investigated for a single wave as well as
for a train of periodic peristaltic waves. Locally variable pressure is seen to
be highly sensitive to the flow index `n'. The study clearly shows that
continuous fluid transport for Newtonian/rheological fluids by wave train
propagation is much more effective than widely spaced single wave propagation
in the case of peristaltic movement of food bolus in the esophagus.

Shear-induced sedimentation in yield stress fluids,http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1505v1,"['Guillaume Ovarlez', 'FranÃ§ois Bertrand', 'Philippe Coussot', 'Xavier Chateau']","  Stability of coarse particles against gravity is an important issue in dense
suspensions (fresh concrete, foodstuff, etc.). On the one hand, it is known
that they are stable at rest when the interstitial paste has a high enough
yield stress; on the other hand, it is not yet possible to predict if a given
material will remain homogeneous during a flow. Using MRI techniques, we study
the time evolution of the particle volume fraction during the flows in a
Couette geometry of model density-mismatched suspensions of noncolloidal
particles in yield stress fluids. We observe that shear induces sedimentation
of the particles in all systems, which are stable at rest. The sedimentation
velocity is observed to increase with increasing shear rate and particle
diameter, and to decrease with increasing yield stress of the interstitial
fluid. At low shear rate ('plastic regime'), we show that this phenomenon can
be modelled by considering that the interstitial fluid behaves like a viscous
fluid -- of viscosity equal to the apparent viscosity of the sheared fluid --
in the direction orthogonal to shear. The behavior at higher shear rates, when
viscous effects start to be important, is also discussed. We finally study the
dependence of the sedimentation velocity on the particle volume fraction, and
show that its modelling requires estimating the local shear rate in the
interstitial fluid.

Laminar flow of two miscible fluids in a simple network,http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.3359v2,"['Casey M. Karst', 'Brian D. Storey', 'John B. Geddes']","  When a fluid comprised of multiple phases or constituents flows through a
network, non-linear phenomena such as multiple stable equilibrium states and
spontaneous oscillations can occur. Such behavior has been observed or
predicted in a number of networks including the flow of blood through the
microcirculation, the flow of picoliter droplets through microfluidic devices,
the flow of magma through lava tubes, and two-phase flow in refrigeration
systems. While the existence of non-linear phenomena in a network with many
inter-connections containing fluids with complex rheology may seem
unsurprising, this paper demonstrates that even simple networks containing
Newtonian fluids in laminar flow can demonstrate multiple equilibria.
  The paper describes a theoretical and experimental investigation of the
laminar flow of two miscible Newtonian fluids of different density and
viscosity through a simple network. The fluids stratify due to gravity and
remain as nearly distinct phases with some mixing occurring only by diffusion.
This fluid system has the advantage that it is easily controlled and modeled,
yet contains the key ingredients for network non-linearities. Experiments and
3D simulations are first used to explore how phases distribute at a single
T-junction. Once the phase separation at a single junction is known, a network
model is developed which predicts multiple equilibria in the simplest of
networks. The existence of multiple stable equilibria is confirmed
experimentally and a criteria for their existence is developed. The network
results are generic and could be applied to or found in different physical
systems.

cutoff surface $\Sigma_c$, dual to the nondynamical and dynamical Chern-Simons
(CS) modified gravities. Using nonrelativistic long-wavelength expansion
method, the field equations are solved up to $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$ in the
nondynamical model. It is shown that there exists nonvortical dual fluid with
shear viscosity $\eta$ and Hall viscosity $\eta_A$ on the cutoff surface
$\Sigma_c$. The ratio of shear viscosity over entropy density $\eta/s$ of the
fluid takes the universal value $1/{4\pi}$, while the ratio of Hall viscosity
over entropy density $\eta_A/s$ depends on the $\Sigma_c$ and black brane
charge $q$. Moreover the nonvortical dual fluid obeys the magnetohydrodynamic

to $\eta$ and $\eta_A$ do not appear in this MHD equation, due to the
constraint condition $\tilde{\partial}^2\beta_j=0$ for the $(2+1)$-dimensional

Dispersive Hydrodynamics in Viscous Fluid Conduits,http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5764v1,"['Nicholas K. Lowman', 'Mark A. Hoefer']","  The evolution of the interface separating a conduit of light, viscous fluid
rising buoyantly through a heavy, more viscous, exterior fluid at small
Reynolds numbers is governed by the interplay between nonlinearity and
dispersion. Previous authors have proposed an approximate model equation based
on physical arguments, but a precise theoretical treatment for this two fluid
system with a free boundary is lacking. Here, a derivation of the interfacial
equation via a multiple scales, perturbation technique is presented.
Perturbations about a state of vertically uniform, laminar conduit flow are
considered in the context of the Navier-Stokes equations with appropriate
boundary conditions. The ratio of interior to exterior viscosities is the small
parameter used in the asymptotic analysis, which leads systematically to a
maximal balance between buoyancy driven, nonlinear self-steepening and viscous,
interfacial stress induced, nonlinear dispersion. This results in a scalar,
nonlinear partial differential equation describing large amplitude dynamics of
the cross-sectional area of the intrusive fluid conduit, in agreement with
previous derivations. The leading order behavior of the two fluid system is
completely characterized in terms of the interfacial dynamics. The regime of
model validity is characterized and shown to agree with previous experimental
studies. Viscous fluid conduits provide a robust setting for the study of

"Combined field formulation and a simple stable explicit interface
  advancing scheme for fluid structure interaction",http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0082v1,['Jie Liu'],"  We develop a combined field formulation for the fluid structure (FS)
interaction problem. The unknowns are (u;p;v), being the fluid velocity, fluid
pressure and solid velocity. This combined field formulation uses Arbitrary
Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) description for the fluid and Lagrangian description
for the solid. It automatically enforces the simultaneous continuities of both
velocity and traction along the FS interface. We present a first order in time
fully discrete scheme when the flow is incompressible Navier-Stokes and when
the solid is elastic. The interface position is determined by first order
extrapolation so that the generation of the fluid mesh and the computation of
(u;p;v) are decoupled. This explicit interface advancing enables us to save
half of the unknowns comparing with traditional monolithic schemes. When the
solid has convex strain energy (e.g. linear elastic), we prove that the total
energy of the fluid and the solid at time t^{n} is bounded by the total energy
at time t^{n-1}. Like in the continuous case, the fluid mesh velocity which is
used in ALE description does not enter into the stability bound. Surprisingly,
the nonlinear convection term in the Navier-Stokes equations plays a crucial
role to stabilize the scheme and the stability result does not apply to Stokes
flow. As the nonlinear convection term is treated semi-implicitly, in each time
step, we only need to solve a linear system (and only once) which involves
merely (u;p;v) if the solid is linear elastic. Two numerical tests including
the benchmark test of Navier-Stokes flow past a Saint Venant-Kirchhoff elastic
bar are performed. In addition to the stability, we also confirm the first
order temporal accuracy of our explicit interface advancing scheme.

A partitioned scheme for fluid-composite structure interaction problems,http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0110v1,"['Martina Bukac', 'Suncica Canic', 'Boris Muha']","  We present a loosely-coupled partitioned scheme for a benchmark problem in
fluid-composite structure interaction. The benchmark problem proposed here
consists of an incompressible, viscous fluid interacting with a composite
structure that consists of two layers: a thin elastic layer which is in contact
with the fluid, and a thick elastic layer which sits on top of the thin layer.
The motivation comes from fluid-structure interaction (FSI) in hemodyam- ics.
The equations of linear elasticity are used to model the thick structural
layer, while the Koiter member/shell equations are used to model the thin
structural layer which serves as fluid-structure interface with mass. An effi-
cient, modular, operator-splitting scheme is proposed to simulate solutions to
the coupled, nonlinear FSI problem. The operator splitting scheme sepa- rates
the elastodynamics structure problem, from a fluid problem in which the thin
structure inertia is included as a Robin-type boundary condition to achieve
unconditional stability, without requiring any sub-iterations within
time-steps. An energy estimate associated with unconditional stability is
derived for the fully nonlinear FSI problem defined on moving domains. Two
instructive numerical examples are presented to test the performance of the
scheme, where it is shown numerically, that the scheme is at least first-order
accurate in time. The second example reveals a new phenomenon in FSI problems:
the presence of a thin fluid-structure interface with mass regularizes
solutions to the full FSI problem.

in time (FIT) and backward in time (BIT) dispersion of fluid and inertial
particle pairs in isotropic turbulence. Fluid particles are known to separate
faster BIT than FIT in three-dimensional turbulence, and we find that inertial
particles do the same. However, we find that the irreversibility in the
inertial particle dispersion is in general much stronger than that for fluid
particles. For example, the ratio of the BIT to FIT mean-square separation can
be up to an order of magnitude larger for inertial particles than for the fluid
particles. We also find that for both the inertial and fluid particles the
irreversibility becomes stronger as the scale of their separation decreases.
Regarding the physical mechanism for the irreversibility, we argue that whereas
the irreversibility of fluid particle-pair dispersion can be understood in
terms of a directional bias arising from the energy transfer process in
turbulence, inertial particles experience an additional source of
irreversibility arising from the non-local contribution to their velocity
dynamics, a contribution which vanishes in the limit ${St\to0}$, where $St$ is
the particle Stokes number. For each given initial (final, in the backward in
time case) separation $\bm{r}^0$ there is an optimum value of $St$ for which
the dispersion irreversibility is strongest, as such particles are optimally
affected by both sources of irreversibility. We derive analytical expressions

poromechanical interactions play an important role in geological and biological
systems across a wide range of scales, from the propagation of magma through
the Earth's mantle to the transport of fluid through living cells and tissues.
The theory of poroelasticity has been largely successful in modeling
poromechanical behavior in relatively simple systems, but this continuum theory
is fundamentally limited by our understanding of the pore-scale interactions
between the fluid and the solid, and these problems are notoriously difficult
to study in a laboratory setting. Here, we present a high-resolution
measurement of injection-driven poromechanical deformation in a system with

poroelasticity theory captures certain macroscopic features of the deformation,

smooth, continuum behavior. We observe particle-scale rearrangement and
hysteresis, as well as petal-like mesoscale structures that are connected to

  State-Space-Collapse Inducing Control with Chattering",http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.7053v1,"['Ohad Perry', 'Ward Whitt']","  Routing mechanisms for stochastic networks are often designed to produce
state space collapse (SSC) in a heavy-traffic limit, i.e., to confine the
limiting process to a lower-dimensional subset of its full state space. In a
fluid limit, a control producing asymptotic SSC corresponds to an ideal sliding
mode control that forces the fluid trajectories to a lower-dimensional sliding
manifold. Within deterministic dynamical systems theory, it is well known that
sliding-mode controls can cause the system to chatter back and forth along the
sliding manifold due to delays in activation of the control. For the prelimit
stochastic system, chattering implies fluid-scaled fluctuations that are larger
than typical stochastic fluctuations. In this paper we show that chattering can
occur in the fluid limit of a controlled stochastic network when inappropriate
control parameters are used. The model has two large service pools operating
under the fixed-queue-ratio with activation and release thresholds (FQR-ART)
overload control which we proposed in a recent paper. We now show that, if the
control parameters are not chosen properly, then delays in activating and
releasing the control can cause chattering with large oscillations in the fluid
limit. In turn, these fluid-scaled fluctuations lead to severe congestion, even
when the arrival rates are smaller than the potential total service rate in the
system, a phenomenon referred to as congestion collapse. We show that the fluid
limit can be a bi-stable switching system possessing a unique nontrivial
periodic equilibrium, in addition to a unique stationary point.

Packing frustration in dense confined fluids,http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1448v1,"['Kim NygÃ¥rd', 'Sten Sarman', 'Roland Kjellander']","  Packing frustration for confined fluids, i.e., the incompatibility between
the preferred packing of the fluid particles and the packing constraints
imposed by the confining surfaces, is studied for a dense hard-sphere fluid
confined between planar hard surfaces at short separations. The detailed
mechanism for the frustration is investigated via an analysis of the
anisotropic pair distributions of the confined fluid, as obtained from integral
equation theory for inhomogeneous fluids at pair correlation level within the
anisotropic Percus-Yevick approximation. By examining the mean forces that
arise from interparticle collisions around the periphery of each particle in
the slit, we calculate the principal components of the mean force for the
density profile - each component being the sum of collisional forces on a
particle's hemisphere facing either surface. The variations of these components
with the slit width give rise to rather intricate changes in the layer
structure between the surfaces, but, as shown in this paper, the basis of these
variations can be easily understood qualitatively and often also
semi-quantitatively. It is found that the ordering of the fluid is in essence
governed locally by the packing constraints at each single solid-fluid
interface. A simple superposition of forces due to the presence of each surface
gives surprisingly good estimates of the density profiles, but there remain
nontrivial confinement effects that cannot be explained by superposition, most
notably the magnitude of the excess adsorption of particles in the slit

applicable to particle-laden fluid flows where two-way momentum coupling is
important. In the point-particle formulation, particle dynamics are coupled to
fluid dynamics via a source term that appears in the respective momentum
equations. When the particle Reynolds number is small and the particle diameter
is smaller than the fluid scales, it is common to approximate the momentum
coupling source term as the Stokes drag. The Stokes drag force depends on the
difference between the undisturbed fluid velocity evaluated at the particle
location, and the particle velocity. However, owing to two-way coupling, the
fluid velocity is modified in the neighborhood of a particle, relative to its
undisturbed value. This causes the computed Stokes drag force to be
underestimated in two-way coupled point-particle simulations. We develop
estimates for the drag force error as function of the particle size relative to
the grid size. We then develop a correction method that estimates the
undisturbed fluid velocity from the computed disturbed velocity field. The
correction scheme is tested for a particle settling in an otherwise quiescent
fluid and is found to reduce the error in computed settling velocity by an
order of magnitude compared with common interpolation schemes.

Solid-like features in dense vapors near the fluid critical point,http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04325v1,"['George Ruppeiner', 'Nathan Dyjack', 'Abigail McAloon', 'Jerry Stoops']","  The phase diagram (pressure versus temperature) of the pure fluid is
typically envisioned as being featureless apart from the presence of the
liquid-vapor coexistence curve terminating at the critical point. However, a
number of recent authors have proposed that this simple picture misses
important features, such as the Widom line, the Fisher-Widom line, and the
Frenkel line. In our paper we discuss another way of augmenting the pure fluid
phase diagram, lines of zero thermodynamic curvature $R=0$ separating regimes
of fluid solid-like behavior ($R>0$) from gas-like or liquid-like behavior
($R<0$). We systematically evaluate $R$ for the $121$ pure fluids in the
NIST/REFPROP (version 9.1) fluid database near the saturated vapor line from
the triple point to the critical point. Our specific goal was to identify
regions of positive $R$ abutting the saturated vapor line (""feature D""). We
found: a) $97/121$ of the NIST/REFPROP fluids have feature D. b) The presence
and character of feature D correlates with molecular complexity, taken to be
the number of atoms $Q$ per molecule. c) The solid-like properties of feature D
might be attributable to a mesoscopic model based on correlations among
coordinated spinning molecules, a model that might be testable with computer
simulations. d) There are a number of correlations between thermodynamic
quantities, including the acentric factor $\omega$, but we found little
explicit correlation between $\omega$ and the shape of a molecule. e) Feature D
seriously constrains the size of the asymptotic fluid critical point regime,
possibly resolving a long-standing mystery about why these are so small. f)
Feature D correlates roughly with regimes of anomalous sound propagation.

Mechanics of granular column collapse in fluid at varying slope angles,http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.09538v1,"['Krishna Kumar', 'Jean-Yves Delenne', 'Kenichi Soga']","  This paper investigates the effect of initial volume fraction on the runout
characteristics of collapse of granular columns on slopes in fluid.
Two-dimensional sub-grain scale numerical simulations are performed to
understand the flow dynamics of granular collapse in fluid. The Discrete
Element (DEM) technique is coupled with the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), for
fluid-grain interactions, to understand the evolution of submerged granular
flows. The fluid phase is simulated using Multiple- Relaxation-Time LBM
(LBM-MRT) for numerical stability. In order to simulate interconnected pore
space in 2D, a reduction in the radius of the grains (hydrodynamic radius) is
assumed during LBM computations. The collapse of granular column in fluid is
compared with the dry cases to understand the effect of fluid on the runout
behaviour. A parametric analysis is performed to assess the influence of the
granular characteristics (initial packing) on the evolution of flow and run-out
distances for slope angles of 0{\deg}, 2.5{\deg}, 5{\deg} and 7.5{\deg}. The
granular flow dynamics is investigated by analysing the effect of hydroplaning,
water entrainment and viscous drag on the granular mass. The mechanism of
energy dissipation, shape of the flow front, water entrainment and evolution of
packing density is used to explain the difference in the flow characteristics
of loose and dense granular column collapse in fluid.

Flow of a viscous nematic fluid around a sphere,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2345v1,"['Manuel GÃ³mez-GonzÃ¡lez', 'Juan C. del Ãlamo']","  We analyze the creeping flow generated by a spherical particle moving through
a viscous fluid with nematic directional order, in which momentum diffusivity
is anisotropic and which opposes resistance to bending. Specifically, we
provide closed-form analytical expressions for the response function, i.e. the
equivalent to Stokes's drag formula for nematic fluids. Particular attention is
given to the rotationally pseudo-isotropic condition defined by zero resistance
to bending, and to the strain pseudo-isotropic condition defined by isotropic
momentum diffusivity. We find the former to be consistent with the rheology of
biopolymer networks and the latter to be closer to the rheology of nematic
liquid crystals. These ""pure"" anisotropic conditions are used to benchmark
existing particle tracking microrheology methods that provide effective
directional viscosities by applying Stokes's drag law separately in different
directions. We find that the effective viscosity approach is phenomenologically
justified in rotationally isotropic fluids, although it leads to significant
errors in the estimated viscosity coefficients. On the other hand, the mere
concept of directional effective viscosities is found to be misleading in
fluids that oppose an appreciable resistance to bending. Finally, we observe
that anisotropic momentum diffusivity leads to asymmetric streamline patterns
displaying enhanced (reduced) streamline deflection in the directions of lower
(higher) diffusivity. The bending resistance of the fluid is found to modulate
the asymmetry of streamline deflection. In some cases, the combined effects of
both anisotropy mechanisms leads to streamline patterns that converge towards
the sphere.

prototypical two-dimensional system reduces to a one-dimensional slit pore.
However, the broken translational symmetry leads to a wetting behavior
strikingly different from that of a slit pore. Using a realistic model of an
atomic fluid with long-ranged Lennard-Jones fluid-fluid and fluid-substrate

diagrams of two-dimensional capped capillaries. Our analysis is based on the
statistical mechanics of fluids, in particular density functional theory. We
show the existence of capillary wetting temperature, which is a property of the
pore, and relatively to the fluid temperature determines whether capillary
condensation is a first-order or a continuous phase transition. We also report
for the first time a first-order capillary wetting transition, which can be
preceded by a first-order capillary prewetting. A full parametric study is
undertaken and we support our findings with exhaustive examples of density

Variational Principles for Stochastic Fluid Dynamics,http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8311v3,['Darryl D. Holm'],"  This paper derives stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) for
fluid dynamics from a stochastic variational principle (SVP). The Legendre
transform of the Lagrangian formulation of these SPDEs yields their Lie-Poisson
Hamiltonian form. The paper proceeds by: taking variations in the SVP to derive
stochastic Stratonovich fluid equations; writing their It\^o representation;
and then investigating the properties of these stochastic fluid models in
comparison with each other, and with the corresponding deterministic fluid
models. The circulation properties of the stochastic Stratonovich fluid
equations are found to closely mimic those of the deterministic ideal fluid
models. As with deterministic ideal flows, motion along the stochastic
Stratonovich paths also preserves the helicity of the vortex field lines in
incompressible stochastic flows. However, these Stratonovich properties are not
apparent in the equivalent It\^o representation, because they are disguised by
the quadratic covariation drift term arising in the Stratonovich to It\^o
transformation. This term is a geometric generalisation of the quadratic
covariation drift term already found for scalar densities in Stratonovich's
famous 1966 paper. The paper also derives motion equations for two examples of
stochastic geophysical fluid dynamics (SGFD); namely, the Euler-Boussinesq and
quasigeostropic approximations.

generates the generalized fluid dynamics that satisfies exact local

also discussed in detail. This constitutes the study of kinematics and dynamics

  equation",http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00573v2,"['E. Molnar', 'H. Niemi', 'D. H. Rischke']","  Fluid-dynamical equations of motion can be derived from the Boltzmann
equation in terms of an expansion around a single-particle distribution
function which is in local thermodynamical equilibrium, i.e., isotropic in
momentum space in the rest frame of a fluid element. However, in situations
where the single-particle distribution function is highly anisotropic in
momentum space, such as the initial stage of heavy-ion collisions at
relativistic energies, such an expansion is bound to break down. Nevertheless,
one can still derive a fluid-dynamical theory, called anisotropic dissipative
fluid dynamics, in terms of an expansion around a single-particle distribution
function, $\hat{f}_{0\bf k}$, which incorporates (at least parts of) the
momentum anisotropy via a suitable parametrization. We construct such an
expansion in terms of polynomials in energy and momentum in the direction of
the anisotropy and of irreducible tensors in the two-dimensional momentum
subspace orthogonal to both the fluid velocity and the direction of the
anisotropy. From the Boltzmann equation we then derive the set of equations of
motion for the irreducible moments of the deviation of the single-particle
distribution function from $\hat{f}_{0\bf k}$. Truncating this set via the
14-moment approximation, we obtain the equations of motion of anisotropic
dissipative fluid dynamics.

filled with an incompressible Boussinesq fluid and maintained at temperatures

the membrane, the two fluid masses form an unstably stratified configuration
with cold and heavy fluid overlying a warmer and lighter fluid and separated by
a non-free interface across which there is a jump in the density. The aim of
this paper is to determine the threshold conditions for convection onset and
associated fluid flow patterns induced by this discontinuous density
stratification. We find that the discontinuity of the density profile leads to
the appearance of temperature perturbation iso-contours that have a lens shape
instead of the classical oval shape and that the mixing is confined to near the
location of the density jump with stagnant and isothermal fluid away from the
discontinuity. We derive the flux conditions at the discontinuity interface and
show that it acts like a heat sink for both the lower and upper fluid layers.
Moreover, we put forth the dependence of the stability threshold parameters for
convection onset on the locus of the density discontinuity. The experimental

compliant viscoelastic layer on a rigid base. This problem relates to
oscillating blood flow in viscoelastic vessels. The deeper motivation for this
study, however, is the possible use of compliant coatings for turbulent drag
reduction. An analytical solution of the fluid and solid velocity is presented,
and five dimensionless parameters emerge. The interaction between fluid and
solid appears to be determined by a single combined dimensionless parameter,
which we call the shear interaction parameter $\chi$. The fluid satisfies a
no-slip boundary condition when $\left|\chi\right| \rightarrow 0$, which occurs
when the solid is heavy, stiff and/or thin. In contrast, the fluid obeys a
free-slip boundary condition when $\left|\chi\right| \rightarrow \infty$, which
corresponds to a lightweight and/or soft solid. Three types of resonance modes
are identified for an elastic solid. Two modes (odd and even) are specific to
the solid. The third mode results from the coupling with the fluid. The three
modes are less pronounced or even absent for a viscoelastic solid. These
findings have a twofold use. First, they help to understand the fluid and solid
dynamics when shear coupling is important. Second, the presented analytical
solution is very useful for validation of numerical fluid-structure-interaction
solvers. Future work might include the extension of the theory to multiple
viscoelastic layers and the dynamic coupling of normal stresses.

dissipative particle dynamics with dynamic virtual particle allocation method
(SDPD-DV) for modeling and simulation of mesoscopic fluids in wall-bounded
domains. The SDPD-DV method is realized with fluid particles, boundary
particles and dynamically allocated virtual particles near solid boundaries.
The physical domain in SDPD-DV contains external and internal solid boundaries,
periodic inlets and outlets, and the fluid region. The solid boundaries of the
domain are represented with boundary particles which have an assigned position,
wall velocity, and temperature upon initialization. The fluid domain is
discretized with fluid particles placed in a global index. The algorithm for
nearest neighbor particle search is based on a combination of the linked-cell
and Verlet-list approaches and utilizes large rectangular cells for
computational efficiency. The density model of a fluid particle in the
proximity of a solid boundary includes the contribution from the virtual
particles in its truncated support domain. The thermodynamic properties of a
virtual particle are identical to those of the corresponding fluid particle.
Additional verification involves SDPD-DV simulations of transient, planar,
Couette liquid water flow. The top plate is moving at and separated by 10-3 m
from the bottom stationary plate. The numerical results are in very good
agreement with the analytical solutions. Additional SDPD-DV verification is
accomplished with the simulation of a body-force driven, low-Reynolds number
flow of water over a cylinder of radius . The SDPD-DV field velocity and
pressure are compared with those obtained by FLUENT.

effective gauge potential which depends on the density $\rho$ of the
condensate, the kinetic energy density of the matter field becomes nonlinear in
$\rho$ and additional flow-dependent terms enter the wave equation for the
phase of the condensate wavefunction. To begin with, we consider a certain
class of density-dependent `single-component' gauge potentials, and later
extend this class to encompass more general `multi-component' potentials. The
nonlinear flow terms are cast into the general form of an inner-product between
the velocity field of the fluid and the gauge potential. This is achieved by
introducing a coupling matrix of dimensionless functions $\gamma_{ij}\left(
\rho \right)$, which characterises the particular functional form of the gauge
potential and regulates the strengths of the nonlinear terms accordingly. In
the momentum-transport equation of the fluid, two non-trivial terms emerge due
to the density-dependent vector potential. A body-force of dilation appears as
a product of the gauge potential and the dilation rate of the fluid, while the
fluid stress tensor features a flow-dependent pressure contribution given by
the inner-product of the gauge potential and the current density of the fluid.

mode decomposition (DMD) and their variants are regularly used to educe
physical mechanisms of nonlinear flow phenomena that cannot be easily
understood through direct inspection. In fluid-structure interaction (FSI)
systems, fluid motion is coupled to vibration and/or deformation of an immersed
structure. Despite this coupling, data analysis is often performed using only
fluid or structure variables, rather than incorporating both. This approach
does not provide information about the manner in which fluid and structure
modes are correlated. We present a framework for performing POD and DMD where
the fluid and structure are treated together. As part of this framework, we
introduce a physically meaningful norm for FSI systems. We first use this
combined fluid-structure formulation to identify correlated flow features and
structural motions in limit-cycle flag flapping. We then investigate the
transition from limit-cycle flapping to chaotic flapping, which can be
initiated by increasing the flag mass. Our modal decomposition reveals that at
the onset of chaos, the dominant flapping motion increases in amplitude and
leads to a bluff-body wake instability. This new bluff-body mode interacts
triadically with the dominant flapping motion to produce flapping at the
non-integer harmonic frequencies previously reported by Connell & Yue (2007).
While our formulation is presented for POD and DMD, there are natural
extensions to other data-analysis techniques.

flow are strongly coupled. For pairs of simple fluids, the microstructure
consists of droplets or bicontinuous demixed domains and the physics is
controlled by the interfaces between these domains. At continuum level, the
structure is defined by a composition field whose gradients which are steep
near interfaces drive its diffusive current. These gradients also cause
thermodynamic stresses which can drive fluid flow. Fluid flow in turn advects
the composition field, while thermal noise creates additional random fluxes
that allow the system to explore its configuration space and move towards the
Boltzmann distribution. This article introduces continuum models of binary
fluids, first covering some well-studied areas such as the thermodynamics and
kinetics of phase separation, and emulsion stability. We then address cases
where one of the fluid components has anisotropic structure at mesoscopic
scales creating nematic (or polar) liquid-crystalline order; this can be
described through an additional tensor (or vector) order parameter field. We
conclude by outlining a thriving area of current research, namely active
emulsions, in which one of the binary components consists of living or

presented for inviscid fluid flow. This approach describes invariants by means
of Lie dragging of scalars, vectors, and skew-tensors with respect to the fluid
velocity, which has the physical meaning of characterizing tensorial quantities
that are frozen into the flow. Several new main results are obtained. First,
simple algebraic and differential operators that can be applied recursively to
derive a complete set of invariants starting from the basic known local and
nonlocal invariants are constructed. Second, these operators are used to derive
infinite hierarchies of local and nonlocal invariants for both adiabatic fluids
and isentropic fluids that are either incompressible, or compressible with
barotropic and non-barotropic equations of state. Each hierarchy is complete in
the sense that no further invariants can be generated from the basic local and
nonlocal invariants. All of the resulting new invariants are related to Ertel's
invariant, the Ertel-Rossby invariant, and Hollmann's invariant. In particular,
for incompressible fluid flow in which the density is non-constant across
different fluid streamlines, a new variant of Ertel's invariant and several new
variants of Hollmann's invariant are derived, where the entropy gradient is
replaced by the density gradient. Third, the physical meaning of these new
invariants and the resulting conserved integrals are discussed, and their

  microchannel due to internal flow of a power-law fluid",http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09065v2,"['Vishal Anand', 'Joshua David JR', 'Ivan C. Christov']","  We study fluid-structure interactions (FSIs) in a long and shallow
microchannel, conveying a non-Newtonian fluid, at steady state. The
microchannel has a linearly elastic and compliant top wall, while its three
other walls are rigid. The fluid flowing inside the microchannel has a
shear-dependent viscosity described by the power-law rheological model. We
employ lubrication theory to solve for the flow problem inside the long and
shallow microchannel. For the structural problem, we employ two plate theories,
namely Kirchhoff-Love theory of thin plates and Reissner-Mindlin first-order
shear deformation theory. The hydrodynamic pressure couples the flow and
deformation problem by acting as a distributed load onto the soft top wall.
Within our perturbative (lubrication theory) approach, we determine the
relationship between flow rate and the pressure gradient, which is a nonlinear
first-order ordinary differential equation for the pressure. From the solution
of this differential equation, all other quantities of interest in
non-Newtonian microchannel FSIs follow. Through illustrative examples, we show
the effect of FSI coupling strength and the plate thickness on the pressure
drop across the microchannel. Through direct numerical simulation of
non-Newtonian microchannel FSIs using commercial computational engineering
tools, we benchmark the prediction from our mathematical prediction for the
flow rate-pressure drop relation and the structural deformation profile of the
top wall. In doing so, we also establish the limits of applicability of our
perturbative theory.

  transverse magnetosonic waves can propagate",http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10241v3,"['P. S. Alekseev', 'A. P. Alekseeva']","  One of the main macroscopic differences between ordinary and highly viscous
fluids is the lack of transverse sound in the first and possibility of its
excitation in the second. In modern high-mobility conductors (Weyl semimetals,
best-quality quantum wells, and graphene) electrons can form a viscous fluid at
low temperatures. In this work we develop high-frequency hydrodynamics of
two-dimensional highly viscous electron fluids in magnetic field. Such fluids
are characterized by simultaneous presence of the excitations associated with
the elastic stress (transverse sound) as well as with the violation of the
local charge neutrality (plasmons). We demonstrate that both the viscoelastic
and the plasmonic components of a flow can exhibit the viscous resonance that
was recently proposed for charged viscous fluids. This resonance is related to
rotation of the viscous stress tensor of a charged fluid in magnetic field. We
argue that the viscous resonance is responsible for the peak and the
peculiarities observed in photoresistance and photovoltage of the ultra-high
mobility GaAs quantum wells. We conclude that a highly viscous electron fluid
(""electron honey"") is realized in those structures.

Quasi-incompressible Multi-species Ionic Fluid Models,http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02665v1,"['Xiaogang Yang', 'Yuezheng Gong', 'Jun Li', 'Robert S. Eisenberg', 'Qi Wang']","  In traditional hydrodynamic theories for ionic fluids, conservation of the
mass and linear momentum is not properly taken care of. In this paper, we
develop hydrodynamic theories for a viscous, ionic fluid of $N$ ionic species
enforcing mass and momentum conservation as well as considering the size effect
of the ionic particles. The theories developed are quasi-incompressible in that
the mass-average velocity is no longer divergence-free whenever there exists
variability in densities of the fluid components, and the models are
dissipative. We present several ways to derive the transport equations for the
ions, which lead to different rates of energy dissipation. The theories can be
formulated in either number densities, volume fractions or mass densities of
the ionic fluid components. We show that the theory with the Cahn-Hilliard
transport equation for ionic species reduces to the classical
Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) model with the size effect for ionic fluids when
the densities of the fluid components are equal and the entropy of the solvent
is neglected. It further reduces to the PNP model when the size effect is
neglected. A linear stability analysis of the model together with two of its

fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems involving viscous incompressible
flow and compressible elastic solids. Deforming composite grids are used to
effectively handle the evolving geometry and large deformations. The fluid is
updated with an implicit-explicit (IMEX) fractional-step scheme whereby the
velocity is advanced in one step, treating the viscous terms implicitly, and
the pressure is computed in a second step. The AMP interface conditions for the
fluid arise from the outgoing characteristic variables in the solid and are
partitioned into a Robin (mixed) interface condition for the pressure, and
interface conditions for the velocity. The latter conditions include an
impedance-weighted average between fluid and solid velocities using a fluid
impedance of a special form. A similar impedance-weighted average is used to
define interface values for the solid. The new algorithm is verified for
accuracy and stability on a number of useful benchmark problems including a
radial-piston problem where exact solutions for radial and azimuthal motions
are found and tested. Traveling wave exact solutions are also derived and
numerically verified for a solid disk surrounded by an annulus of fluid. Fluid
flow in a channel past a deformable solid annulus is computed and errors are
estimated from a self-convergence grid refinement study. The AMP scheme is
found to be stable and second-order accurate even for very difficult cases of

treatment of sub-grid scale convection, including net mass transport by
convection and non-equilibrium dynamics. The technique involves splitting the
atmosphere into multiple fluids. For example, the atmosphere could be divided
into buoyant updrafts and stable regions. The fluids interact through a common
pressure, drag and mass transfers (entrainment and detrainment). Little is
known about the numerical properties of mass transfer terms between the fluids.
We derive mass transfer terms which relabel the fluids and derive numerical
properties of the transfer schemes, including boundedness, momentum
conservation and energy conservation. Numerical solutions of the multi-fluid

  turbulent flow",http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07575v2,"['Muhammad Zubair Sheikh', 'Kristian Gustavsson', 'Diego Lopez', 'Emmanuel Leveque', 'Bernhard Mehlig', 'Alain Pumir', 'Aurore Naso']","  How non-spherical particles orient as they settle in a flow has important
practical implications in a number of scientific and engineering problems. In a
quiescent fluid, a slowly settling particle orients so that it settles with its
broad side first. This is an effect of the torque due to convective inertia of
the fluid set in motion by the settling particle, which maximises the drag
experienced by the particle. Turbulent flows tend to randomise the particle
orientation. Recently the settling of non-spherical particles in turbulence was
analysed neglecting the effect of convective fluid inertia, but taking into
account the effect of the turbulent fluid-velocity gradients on the particle
orientation. These studies reached the opposite conclusion, namely that a rod
settles preferentially with its tip first, wheras a disk settles with its edge
first, therefore minimizing the drag on the particle. Here, we consider both
effects, the convective inertial torque as well as the torque due to
fluctuating velocity gradients, and ask under which circumstances either one or
the other dominate. To this end we estimate the ratio of the magnitudes of the
two torques. Our estimates suggest that the fluid-inertia torque prevails in
high-Reynolds number flows. In this case non-spherical particles are expected
to settle with a maximal drag. But when the Reynolds number is small then the
torque due to fluid-velocity gradients may dominate, causing the particle to
settle with its broad side first.

  liquid cores",http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11837v2,"['Santiago Andres Triana', 'Jeremy Rekier', 'Antony Trinh', 'Veronique Dehant']","  The Earth is a rapidly rotating body. The centrifugal pull makes its shape
resemble a flattened ellipsoid and Coriolis forces support waves in its fluid
core, known as inertial waves. These waves can lead to global oscillations, or
modes, of the fluid. Periodic variations of the Earth's rotation axis
(nutations) can lead to an exchange of angular momentum between the mantle and
the fluid core and excite these inertial modes. In addition to viscous torques
that exist regardless of the shape of the boundaries, the small flattening of
the core-mantle boundary (CMB) allows inertial modes to exert pressure torques
on the mantle. These torques effectively couple the rigid-body dynamics of the
Earth with the fluid dynamics of the fluid core. Here we present the first high
resolution numerical model that solves simultaneously the rigid body dynamics
of the mantle and the Navier-Stokes equation for the liquid core. This method
takes naturally into account dissipative processes in the fluid that are
ignored in current nutation models. We find that the Free Core Nutation (FCN)
mode, mostly a toroidal fluid flow if the mantle has a large moment of inertia,
enters into resonance with nearby modes if the mantle's moment of inertia is
reduced. These mode interactions seem to be completely analogous to the ones
discovered by Schmitt (2006) in a uniformly rotating ellipsoid with varying
flattening.

fundamental importance in a range of applications including tsunami and
internal ocean wave modelling. This study is performed in the context of the
viscous fluid conduit system-the driven, cylindrical, free interface between
two miscible Stokes fluids with high viscosity contrast. Due to buoyancy
induced nonlinear self-steepening balanced by stress induced interfacial
dispersion, the disturbance evolves into a slowly modulated wavetrain and
further, into a sequence of solitary waves. An extension of Whitham modulation
theory, termed the solitary wave resolution method, is used to resolve the
fission of an initial disturbance into solitary waves. The developed theory
predicts the relationship between the initial disturbance's profile, the number
of emergent solitary waves, and their amplitude distribution, quantifying an
extension of the well-known soliton resolution conjecture from integrable
systems to non-integrable systems that often provide a more accurate modelling
of physical systems. The theoretical predictions for the fluid conduit system
are confirmed both numerically and experimentally. The number of observed
solitary waves is consistently within 1-2 waves of the prediction, and the
amplitude distribution shows remarkable agreement. Universal properties of
solitary wave fission in other fluid dynamics problems are identified.

interface conditions in normal and tangential orientation and especially the
role of the fluid stress within the region of closed contact are discussed for
the general problem of FSCI. To ensure continuity of the tangential constraints
from no-slip to frictionless contact, a transition is enabled by using the
general Navier condition with varying slip length. Moreover, the fluid stress
in the contact zone is obtained by an extension approach as it plays a crucial
role for the lift-off behavior of contacting bodies. With the given continuity
of the spatially continuous formulation, continuity of the discrete problem

Non-Newtonian fluid flow in porous media,http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10570v1,"['Christopher A. Bowers', 'Cass T. Miller']","  Single fluid porous medium systems are typically modeled at an averaged
length scale termed the macroscale using Darcy's law. Standard approaches for
modeling macroscale single fluid phase flow of non-Newtonian fluids extend
Darcy's law, using an effective viscosity and assuming that the permeability is
invariant. This approach results in a need to determine the effective viscosity
for every fluid and flow rate. We use the thermodynamically constrained
averaging theory (TCAT) to examine the formulation and closure of a macroscale
model for non-Newtonian flow that is consistent with microscale conservation
principles and the second law of thermodynamics. A connection between
microscale and macroscale quantities is used to calculate interphase momentum
transfer for non-Newtonian flow in porous medium systems. Darcy's law is shown
to approximate momentum transfer from the fluid phase to the solid phase. This
momentum transfer is found to depend on the viscosity at the solid surface. As
a consequence of the derived equation for momentum transfer, the commonly
called intrinsic permeability is not invariant for non-Newtonian flow, which is
an assumption that underlies standard effective viscosity approaches. TCAT is
used to derive a macroscale equation relating the flow rate and the pressure
gradient dependent upon fluid properties and medium characterization, breaking
the need to investigate all flow and composition conditions currently required.
This new approach is validated for model systems and used to interpret results
from the literature, including an evaluation of conditions under which a
transition occurs away from the strictly laminar flow conditions. The results
from this work form a basis for more rigorous and realistic modeling of

have diffusivities larger (by factors of trillions or more) than baryonic

A fluid particle model,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9709024v1,['Pep EspaÃ±ol'],"  We present a mechanistic model for a Newtonian fluid called fluid particle
dynamics. By analyzing the concept of ``fluid particle'' from the point of view
of a Voronoi tessellation of a molecular fluid, we propose an heuristic
derivation of a dissipative particle dynamics algorithm that incorporates shear
forces between dissipative particles. The inclusion of these non-central shear
forces requires the consideration of angular velocities of the dissipative
particles in order to comply with the conservation of angular momentum. It is
shown that the equilibrium statistical mechanics requirement that the linear
and angular velocity fields are Gaussian is sufficient to construct the random
thermal forces between dissipative particles. The proposed algorithm is very
similar in structure to the (isothermal) smoothed particle dynamics algorithm.
In this way, this work represents a generalization of smoothed particle
dynamics that incorporates consistently thermal fluctuations and exact angular
momentum conservation. It contains also the dissipative particle dynamics
algorithm as a special case. Finally, the kinetic theory of the dissipative
particles is derived and explicit expressions of the transport coefficients of
the fluid in terms of model parameters are obtained. This allows to discuss
resolution issues for the model.

The liquid-vapor interface of an ionic fluid,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9710335v1,"['B. Groh', 'R. Evans', 'S. Dietrich']","  We investigate the liquid-vapor interface of the restricted primitive model
(RPM) for an ionic fluid using a density-functional approximation based on
correlation functions of the homogeneous fluid as obtained from the
mean-spherical approximation (MSA). In the limit of a homogeneous fluid our
approach yields the well-known MSA (energy) equation of state. The ionic
interfacial density profiles, which for the RPM are identical for both species,
have a shape similar to those of simple atomic fluids in that the decay towards
the bulk values is more rapid on the vapor side than on the liquid side. This
is the opposite asymmetry of the decay to that found in earlier calculations
for the RPM based on a square-gradient theory. The width of the interface is,
for a wide range of temperatures, approximately four times the second moment
correlation length of the liquid phase. We discuss the magnitude and
temperature dependence of the surface tension, and argue that for temperatures
near the triple point the ratio of the dimensionless surface tension and
critical temperature is much smaller for the RPM than for simple atomic fluids.

Viscous fingering patterns in ferrofluids,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9802194v1,"['Michael Widom', 'Jose A. Miranda']","  Viscous fingering occurs in the flow of two immiscible, viscous fluids
between the plates of a Hele-Shaw cell. Due to pressure gradients or gravity,
the initially planar interface separating the two fluids undergoes a
Saffman-Taylor instability and develops finger-like structures. When one of the
fluids is a ferrofluid and a perpendicular magnetic field is applied, the
labyrinthine instability supplements the usual viscous fingering instability,
resulting in visually striking, complex patterns. We consider this problem in a
rectangular flow geometry using a perturbative mode-coupling analysis. We
deduce two general results: viscosity contrast between the fluids drives
interface asymmetry, with no contribution from magnetic forces; magnetic
repulsion within the ferrofluid generates finger tip-splitting, which is absent
in the rectangular geometry for ordinary fluids.

Fluctuation-dissipation relation in a sheared fluid,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0003346v2,"['Jean-Louis Barrat', 'Ludovic Berthier']","  In a fluid out of equilibrium, the fluctuation dissipation theorem (FDT) is

relationship between correlation and response functions in a fluid driven into
a stationary non-equilibrium state. Both the high temperature fluid state and
the low temperature glassy state are investigated. In the glassy state, the
violation of the FDT is quantitatively identical to the one observed previously
in an aging system in the absence of external drive. In the fluid state,
violations of the FDT appear only when the fluid is driven beyond the linear
response regime, and are then similar to those observed in the glassy state.
These results are consistent with the picture obtained earlier from theoretical
studies of driven mean-field disordered models, confirming the similarity

illustrate how LG-equations can be derived for the order parameter, being the
rate of deformation or shear rate tensor, which controls the formation of

First, we consider a symmetric mixture with attractive interactions, possibly
relevant for describing fluids of molecules with internal degrees of freedom.
Despite the simplicity of the model, slightly tuning the strength of the
interactions between unlike species drastically changes the topology of the
phase boundary, forcing or inhibiting demixing, and brings about several
interesting features such as double critical points, tricritical points, and
coexistence domains enclosing `islands' of homogeneous, mixed fluid.
Homogeneous phase separation in mixtures can be driven also by purely repulsive

The relationship between $S$ and ${\bar S}$ is established by expressing $S$ in
Hamiltonian form and identifying certain canonical coordinates as ignorable.

mathematical method belonging to the class of Darboux transformations. The
procedure works for zero cosmological constant at the price of introducing a
new constant parameter related to the time dependence of the adiabatic index.
These fluids can be the real cosmological fluids that are encountered at
cosmological scales and they could be used as a simple and efficient
explanation for the recent experimental findings regarding the present day
accelerating universe. In addition, new types of cosmological scale factors,
corresponding to these fluids, are presented

Quantum cosmological perfect fluid model and its classical analogue,http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0108053v1,"['A. B. Batista', 'J. C. Fabris', 'S. V. B. Goncalves', 'Joel Tossa']","  The quantization of gravity coupled to a perfect fluid model leads to a
Schr\""odinger-like equation, where the matter variable plays the role of time.
The wave function can be determined, in the flat case, for an arbitrary
barotropic equation of state $p = \alpha\rho$; solutions can also be found for
the radiative non-flat case. The wave packets are constructed, from which the
expectation value for the scale factor is determined. The quantum scenarios
reveal a bouncing Universe, free from singularity. We show that such quantum
cosmological perfect fluid models admit a universal classical analogue,
represented by the addition, to the ordinary classical model, of a repulsive
stiff matter fluid. The meaning of the existence of this universal classical
analogue is discussed. The quantum cosmological perfect fluid model is, for a
flat spatial section, formally equivalent to a free particle in ordinary

is equivalent to the harmonic oscillator. The repulsive fluid needed to
reproduce the quantum results is the same in both cases.

to a massless scalar field, we construct the critical solution as a scalar
field solution by making a self-similarity ansatz. We find evidence that this

critical exponent, gamma ~ 0.94, derived from its eigenvalue agree with those
measured in perfect fluid collapse simulations. We explain why this solution is
seen as a critical solution in stiff fluid collapse but not in scalar field

Lagrangian theory for perfect fluids,http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0303015v1,['Sawa Manoff'],"  The theory of perfect fluids is reconsidered from the point of view of a
covariant Lagrangian theory. It has been shown that the Euler-Lagrange
equations for a perfect fluid could be found in spaces with affine connections
and metrics from an unconstrained variational principle by the use of the
method of Lagrangians with covariant derivatives (MLCD) and additional
conditions for reparametrizations of the proper time of the mass elements
(particles) of the perfect fluid. The last conditions are not related to the
variational principle and are not considered as constraints used in the process
of variations. The application of the whole structure of a Lagrangian theory
with an appropriate choice of Lagrangian invariant as the pressure of the fluid
shows that the Euler-Lagrange equations with their corresponding
energy-momentum tensors lead to Navier-Stokes' equation identical with the
Euler equation for a perfect fluid in a space with one affine connection and
metrics. The Navier-Stokes equations appear as higher order equations with
respect to the Euler-Lagrange equations.

conclusions, drawn from model studies, can also be expected to arise in
significantly more complex, realistic fluid dynamics simulations of heavy ion

stationary perturbations of turbulence. Cavitation of the turbulent

the top of the curtain enters a pendulum-like motion, coupled to a propagative
pattern of curtain undulations, structured as a chessboard. Measurements of the

Intrinsic Geometric Structure of Turbulent Flow for Newton Fluid,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0601006v1,['Jianhua Xiao'],"  Many researches show that the complicated motion of fluid, such as
turbulence, cannot be well solved by the Navier-Stokes equation. Chen Zida has
founded that the definition of vortex, based on the Stokes decomposition,
cannot well describe the local rotation when the velocity gradient is highly
asymmetric. Chen reformulates the Stokes S+R decomposition into a general S+R
decomposition. By further extending Chen results, this research studies the
motion equation of fluid for the case where highly asymmetric velocity gradient
is exhibited. The result shows that the classical NS equation does not meet the
requirement of angular momentum conservation, which is apparently ignored for
infinitesimal velocity gradient of fluid. This paper reformulates the intrinsic
geometric description of fluid motion and two additional equations are
introduced. Combining with the classical NS equation, the reformulated motion
equations are in closed-form. The research shows that the NS equation is good
approximation for average flow, so it can not solve the turbulent problem in
essential sense. However, this conclusion does not deny that with suitable
additional condition for special engineering problem it is still a would-be
acceptable approximation.

  Quadrupole",http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0112123v1,"['S. De Nicola', 'R. Fedele', ""V. I. Man'ko""]","  A classical description of the dynamics of a dissipative charged-particle

classical fluid equations contains the same information as a complex function
satisfying a Schrodinger-like equation in which Planck's constant is replaced
by the time-varying emittance, which is related to the time-varying temperature
of the fluid. The squared modulus and the gradient of the phase of this complex
function are proportional to the fluid density and to the current velocity,
respectively. Within this framework, the dynamics of an electron bunch in a

High-Speed Cylindrical Collapse of Two Perfect Fluids,http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.2647v1,"['M. Sharif', 'Zahid Ahmad']","  In this paper, the study of the gravitational collapse of cylindrically
distributed two perfect fluid system has been carried out. It is assumed that
the collapsing speeds of the two fluids are very large. We explore this
condition by using the high-speed approximation scheme. There arise two cases,
i.e., bounded and vanishing of the ratios of the pressures with densities of
two fluids given by $c_s, d_s$. It is shown that the high-speed approximation
scheme breaks down by non-zero pressures $p_1, p_2$ when $c_s, d_s$ are bounded
below by some positive constants. The failure of the high-speed approximation
scheme at some particular time of the gravitational collapse suggests the
uncertainity on the evolution at and after this time. In the bounded case, the
naked singularity formation seems to be impossible for the cylindrical two
perfect fluids. For the vanishing case, if a linear equation of state is used,
the high-speed collapse does not break down by the effects of the pressures and
consequently a naked singularity forms. This work provides the generalisation
of the results already given by Nakao and Morisawa [1] for the perfect fluid.

Multidimensional fluid motions with planar waves,http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.2311v1,['Sergey V. Golovin'],"  In the classical one-dimensional solution of fluid dynamics equations all
unknown functions depend only on time t and Cartesian coordinate x. Although
fluid spreads in all directions (velocity vector has three components) the
whole picture of motion is relatively simple: trajectory of one fluid particle
from plane x=const completely determines motion of the whole plane. Basing on
the symmetry analysis of differential equations we propose generalization of
this solution allowing movements in different directions of fluid particles
belonging to plane x=const. At that, all functions but an angle determining the
direction of particle's motion depend on t and x only, whereas the angle
depends on all coordinates. In this solution the whole picture of motion
superposes from identical trajectories placed under different angles in 3D
space. Orientations of the trajectories are restricted by a finite relation
possessing functional arbitrariness. The solution describes three-dimensional
nonlinear processes and singularities in infinitely conducting plasma, gas or

but also a helix. We examine the particular case where these two superimposed
helices have different handedness, and employ a combination of experimental,
analytic, and computational methods to determine the rotational velocity of
superhelical bodies being towed through a very viscous fluid. We find that the
direction and rate of the rotation of the body is a result of competition
between the two superimposed helices; for small axial helix amplitude, the body
dynamics is controlled by the short-pitched helix, while there is a cross-over
at larger amplitude to control by the axial helix. We find far better, and
excellent, agreement of our experimental results with numerical computations

is controlled by the capillary and Peclet numbers. We estimate the crossover
from a meniscus to a thin film and find good agreement with numerical results.
The penetration regime is examined in the steady state. We find that the
occupation fraction of the advancing finger relative to the channel thickness

previous results. For zero viscosity contrast, we observe remarkably narrow

conditions, the flow can violate the generalized second law of thermodynamics.
The paradox indicates that there is in fact a lower bound to the correlation
length of any \textit{real} fluid, the value of which is determined by the
thermodynamic properties of that fluid. We observe that the universal bound on
entropy, itself suggested by the generalized second law, puts a lower bound on
the correlation length of any fluid in terms of its specific entropy. With the
help of a new, efficient estimate for the viscosity of liquids, we argue that
this also means that viscosity is bounded from below in a way reminiscent of
the conjectured Kovtun-Son-Starinets lower bound on the ratio of viscosity to
entropy density. We conclude that much light may be shed on the

The computations are done at every point in the relative velocity subspace,
thus giving a sensitivity field. The Stokes number being a measure of the

systematic procedure developed recently by Bhattacharyya, Hubeny, Minwalla, and

black-brane evolution will generically correspond to a turbulent flow.
Turbulence in 2+1 dimensions has been well studied analytically, numerically,
experimentally, and observationally as it provides a first approximation to the
large scale dynamics of planetary atmospheres. These studies reveal dramatic
differences between fluid flows in 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions, suggesting that the

qualitatively different. However, further investigation is required to
understand whether these qualitative differences exist in the regime of fluid

Arrest of Fluid Demixing by Nanoparticles: A Computer Simulation Study,http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.0392v1,"['E. Kim', 'K. Stratford', 'R. Adhikari', 'M. E. Cates']","  We use lattice Boltzmann simulations to investigate the formation of arrested
structures upon demixing of a binary solvent containing neutrally wetting

to the formation of `bijels': bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gels.
These should be created when a glassy monolayer of particles forms at the
fluid-fluid interface, arresting further demixing, and rigidifying the
structure. Experimental work has broadly confirmed this scenario, but shows
that bijels can also be formed in volumetrically asymmetric quenches. Here we
present new simulation results for such quenches, compare these to the
symmetric case, and find a crossover to an arrested droplet phase at strong
asymmetry. We then make extensive new analyses of the post-arrest dynamics in
our simulated bijel and droplet structures, on time scales comparable to the
Brownian time for colloid motion. Our results suggest that, on these
intermediate time scales, the effective activation barrier to ejection of
particles from the fluid-fluid interface is smaller by at least two orders of

interstellar medium (ISM) based on self-consistent two-dimensional fluid

medium (ISM) that couples a neutral hydrogen fluid with a plasma primarily
through charge exchange interactions. Charge exchange interactions are
ubiquitous in warm ISM plasma and the strength of the interaction depends
largely on the relative speed between the plasma and the neutral fluid. Unlike
small length-scale linear collisional dissipation in a single fluid, charge
exchange processes introduce channels that can be effective on a variety of
length-scales that depend on the neutral and plasma densities, temperature,
relative velocities, charge exchange cross section and the characteristic
length scales. We find, from scaling arguments and nonlinear coupled fluid
simulations, that charge exchange interactions modify spectral transfer
associated with large scale energy containing eddies. Consequently, the warm
ISM turbulent cascade rate prolongs spectral transfer amongst inertial range
turbulent modes. Turbulent spectra associated with the neutral and plasma ISM
fluids are therefore steeper than those predicted by Kolmogorov's

Euler's fluid equations: Optimal Control vs Optimization,http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.4289v4,['Darryl D. Holm'],"  An optimization method used in image-processing (metamorphosis) is found to
imply Euler's equations for incompressible flow of an inviscid fluid, without
requiring that the Lagrangian particle labels exactly follow the flow lines of
the Eulerian velocity vector field. Thus, an optimal control problem and an
optimization problem for incompressible ideal fluid flow both yield the \emph
{same} Euler fluid equations, although their Lagrangian parcel dynamics are
\emph{different}. This is a result of the \emph{gauge freedom} in the
definition of the fluid pressure for an incompressible flow, in combination
with the symmetry of fluid dynamics under relabeling of their Lagrangian
coordinates. Similar ideas are also illustrated for SO(N) rigid body motion.

Life at high Deborah number,http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.4494v1,['Eric Lauga'],"  In many biological systems, microorganisms swim through complex polymeric
fluids, and usually deform the medium at a rate faster than the inverse fluid
relaxation time. We address the basic properties of such life at high Deborah
number analytically by considering the small-amplitude swimming of a body in an
arbitrary complex fluid. Using asymptotic analysis and differential geometry,
we show that for a given swimming gait, the time-averaged leading-order
swimming kinematics of the body can be expressed as an integral equation on the
solution to a series of simpler Newtonian problems. We then use our results to
demonstrate that Purcell's scallop theorem, which states that time-reversible
body motion cannot be used for locomotion in a Newtonian fluid, breaks down in
polymeric fluid environments.

In kinetic theory shear viscosity is related to momentum transport by
quasi-particles, and the uncertainty relation implies that the ratio of shear
viscosity eta to entropy density s is bounded by a constant multiplied by
hbar/k_B, where hbar is Planck's constant and k_B is Boltzmann's constant. A
specific bound has been proposed on the basis of string theory. In a large
class of theories that can be studied using string theory methods the constant
is 1/(4\pi). Experiments at RHIC indicate that eta/s of the quark gluon plasma
is close to this prediction. We will refer to a fluid that saturates the string
theory bound as a perfect fluid. In this contribution we summarizes the

Single-Phase Flow of Non-Newtonian Fluids in Porous Media,http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.2399v1,['Taha Sochi'],"  The study of flow of non-Newtonian fluids in porous media is very important
and serves a wide variety of practical applications in processes such as
enhanced oil recovery from underground reservoirs, filtration of polymer
solutions and soil remediation through the removal of liquid pollutants. These
fluids occur in diverse natural and synthetic forms and can be regarded as the
rule rather than the exception. They show very complex strain and time
dependent behavior and may have initial yield-stress. Their common feature is
that they do not obey the simple Newtonian relation of proportionality between
stress and rate of deformation. Non-Newtonian fluids are generally classified
into three main categories: time-independent whose strain rate solely depends
on the instantaneous stress, time-dependent whose strain rate is a function of
both magnitude and duration of the applied stress and viscoelastic which shows
partial elastic recovery on removal of the deforming stress and usually
demonstrates both time and strain dependency. In this article the key aspects
of these fluids are reviewed with particular emphasis on single-phase flow
through porous media. The four main approaches for describing the flow in
porous media are examined and assessed. These are: continuum models, bundle of
tubes models, numerical methods and pore-scale network modeling.

stress-energy tensor is a sum of a perfect fluid and a radial imperfect fluid
component. In the special situations where the perfect fluid component vanishes
or is a spacetime constant, the solutions to Einstein's equations can be
thought of as modified Schwarzschild and Schwarzschild-de Sitter spaces. Exact
solutions of this type are derived and it is shown that whereas deviations from
the unmodified solutions can be made small, among the manifestations of the
imperfect fluid component is a shift in angular momentum scaling for orbiting
test-bodies at large radius. Based on this effect, the question of whether the

one-component fluids. Our results for the structural properties of roll
convection resemble qualitatively the situation in the Rayleigh--B\'enard

describe the transport of momentum. In addition to the properties of the rolls,
their stability against arbitrary infinitesimal perturbations is investigated.
We compute stability balloons for the pure fluid case as well as for a wide

operators subject to consistency conditions. Thermal fluctuations are taken

boundary conditions are developed where periodic images are shifted relative to

the formalism. As a demonstration of the methods, results are presented for the

Exchange flow of two immiscible fluids and the principle of maximum flux,http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0862v1,['R. R. Kerswell'],"  The steady, coaxial flow in which two immiscible, incompressible fluids move
past each other in a cylindrical tube has a continuum of possibilities due to
the arbitrariness of the interface between the fluids. By invoking the presence
of surface tension to at least restrict the shape of any interface to that of a
circular arc or full circle, we consider the following question: which flow
will maximise the exchange when there is only one dividing interface Gamma?
Surprisingly, the answer differs fundamentally from the better-known
co-directional two-phase flow situation where an axisymmetric (concentric)
core-annular solution always optimises the flux. Instead, the maximal flux
state is invariably asymmetric either being a `side-by-side' configuration
where Gamma starts and finishes at the tube wall or an eccentric core-annular
flow where Gamma is an off-centre full circle in which the more viscous fluid
is surrounded by the less viscous fluid. The side-by-side solution is the most
efficient exchanger for a small viscosity ratio beta less than or equal to 4.60
with an eccentric core-annular solution optimal otherwise. At large beta, this
eccentric solution provides 51% more flux than the axisymmetric core-annular
flow which is always a local minimiser of the flux.

the size of the millimetric droplets; the height of the free fall, ranging from

granular layer, energy is dissipated and a splash of grain occurs. Meanwhile,
surface tension, inertia and viscosity compete, leading to strong deformations
of the drop which depend on the experimental conditions. Just after the drop
enters into contact with the granular bed, imbibition takes place and increases
the apparent viscosity of the fluid. The drop motion is stopped by this

Slow Burgers Vortices in Hot Conformal Fluids,http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.5557v1,['Jarah Evslin'],"  The quintessential vortex solution in (3+1)-dimensional nonrelativistic,
incompressible fluid mechanics is the Burgers vortex. We show that, in a finite
domain, conformal fluids also admit hot vortex solutions with everywhere
nonrelativistic speeds. These are identical to Burgers' solution, except that
their radius is reduced by a factor of 2/sqrt(3). A rough calculation indicates
that at RHIC these vortices are indeed smaller than the fireball itself during
thermalization. Similarly to the Burgers vortex, these solutions manifest
vortex stretching which avoids short distance singularities and so suggests
that conformal fluid flows share the same nonsingularity as solutions of the
Navier-Stokes equations. Naively generalizing this calculation to an arbitrary
equation of state w, we observe that the Burgers vortex radius diverges as w
crosses -1. While it has been argued that such a crossover leads to an
instability in certain perfect fluids, the absence of Burgers vortices and
therefore vortex stretching suggests that, in addition to the well-studied big
rip singularities, viscous phantom fluids generically develop vorticity
singularities.

zero temperature. We call this phase a quantum fluid. We argue that the
signature of the transition is the change of sign of the chemical potential,
being negative in the normal phase and becoming positive in the quantum fluid
phase. We show that this change is characterized by a phenomenon that we call
condensation, in which a macroscopic number of particles is in their own
many-body ground state, a situation common to Fermi and Bose gases. We show
that the ideal Bose-Einstein Condensation fits in this scenario, but that it
also permits the occurrence of a situation that we may call ""Fermi-Dirac
Condensation"". In addition, we argue that this phenomenon is also behind the
development of superfluid phases in real interacting fluids. However, only
interacting systems may show the change from a thermal fluid to a quantum one
as a true phase transition. As a corollary, this argument shows the necessity
of the appearance of a ""supersolid"" phase. We also indicate how these ideas may
be useful in the description of of experiments with ultracold alkali gases.

be atributed to a pressure mimicking mechanism related to the non-minimal

for the fluctuation dynamics. Thus, we regard the motion of a fluid parcel on
the computationally resolvable length scales as a moving Lagrange coordinate
for the fluctuating (zero-mean) motion of fluid parcels at the unresolved
scales. Even in the simplest 2-scale version on which we concentrate here, the
contributions of the fluctuating motion under the KSA to the mean motion yields
a system of equations that extends known results and appears to be suitable for
modelling nonlinear backscatter (energy transfer from smaller to larger scales)

Selective decay by Casimir dissipation in fluids,http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.2607v2,"['F. Gay-Balmaz', 'D. D. Holm']","  The problem of parameterizing the interactions of larger scales and smaller
scales in fluid flows is addressed by considering a property of two-dimensional
incompressible turbulence. The property we consider is selective decay, in
which a Casimir of the ideal formulation (enstrophy in 2D flows, helicity in 3D
flows) decays in time, while the energy stays essentially constant. This paper
introduces a mechanism that produces selective decay by enforcing Casimir
dissipation in fluid dynamics. This mechanism turns out to be related in
certain cases to the numerical method of anticipated vorticity discussed in
\cite{SaBa1981,SaBa1985}. Several examples are given and a general theory of
selective decay is developed that uses the Lie-Poisson structure of the ideal
theory. A scale-selection operator allows the resulting modifications of the
fluid motion equations to be interpreted in several examples as parameterizing
the nonlinear, dynamical interactions between disparate scales. The type of
modified fluid equation systems derived here may be useful in modelling
turbulent geophysical flows where it is computationally prohibitive to rely on
the slower, indirect effects of a realistic viscosity, such as in large-scale,
coherent, oceanic flows interacting with much smaller eddies.

different character and affects the particle motion differently. Because of the
bounding walls, viscous diffusion is hampered, and the accompanying shear flow
is gradually diminished. However, the sound wave is repeatedly reflected and
spreads diffusely. As a result, the particle motion is governed by the sound
wave and backtracks differently in a bulk fluid. The time when the backtracking
of the particle occurs changes non-monotonically with respect to the

Higher Derivative Corrections to Charged Fluids in 2n Dimensions,http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00142v2,"['Nabamita Banerjee', 'Suvankar Dutta', 'Akash Jain']","  We study anomalous charged fluid in $2n$-dimensions ($n\geq 2$) up to

constraints on different sub-leading order transport coefficients appearing in
parity-even and odd sectors of the fluid. We introduce a new mechanism to count
different fluid data at arbitrary derivative order. We show that only the

Collisional behaviors of astrophysical collisionless plasmas,http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00626v1,['Antoine Bret'],"  In collisional fluids, a number of key processes rely on the frequency of
binary collisions. Collisions seem necessary to generate a shock wave when two
fluids collide fast enough, to fulfill the Rankine-Hugoniot relations, to
establish an equation of state or a Maxwellian distribution. Yet, these
seemingly collisional features are routinely either observed or assumed, in
relation with collision\emph{less} astrophysical plasmas. This article will
review our current answers to the following questions: How do colliding
collisionless plasmas end-up generating a shock as if they were fluids? To
which extent are the Rankine-Hugoniot relations fulfilled in this case? Do
collisionless shocks propagate like fluid ones? Can we use an equation of state
to describe collisionless plasmas, like MHD codes for astrophysics do? Why are
Maxwellian distributions ubiquitous in Particle-In-Cell simulations of
collisionless shocks? Time and length scales defining the border between the
collisional and the collisionless behavior will be given when relevant. In
general, when the time and length scales involved in the collisionless
processes responsible for the fluid-like behavior may be neglected, the system
may be treated like a fluid.

"Drag and diffusion coefficients of a spherical particle attached to a

spherical particle attached to the interface between two immiscible fluids are
constructed for the case of a small viscosity ratio between the fluid phases.
The model is designed to explicitly account for the dependence on the contact
angle between the two fluids and the solid surface. The Lorentz reciprocal
theorem is applied in the context of a geometric perturbation approach, which
is based on the deviation of the contact angle from a 90{\deg}-value. By
testing the model against experimental and numerical data from the literature,
good agreement is found within the entire range of contact angles below
90{\deg}. As an advantage of the method reported, the drag and diffusion
coefficients can be calculated up to second order in the perturbation
parameter, while it is sufficient to know the velocity and pressure fields only
up to first order. Extensions to other particle shapes with known velocity and
pressure fields are straightforward.

the fluid layers are strongly correlated. The structural transition between

no thermodynamic phase transition occurs. The high density structure of the

underlying microscopic theory is a finite temperature $\mathcal{N}=4$

black brane solutions of the Einstein gravity in asymptotically \emph{locally}

expressing it in terms of the memory function formalism, which is also suitable
for practical simulations. In addition to two viscosity functions discussed at

Finite-time barriers to front propagation in two-dimensional fluid flows,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08240v1,"['John R. Mahoney', 'Kevin A. Mitchell']","  Recent theoretical and experimental investigations have demonstrated the role
of certain invariant manifolds, termed burning invariant manifolds (BIMs), as
one-way dynamical barriers to reaction fronts propagating within a flowing
fluid. These barriers form one-dimensional curves in a two-dimensional fluid
flow. In prior studies, the fluid velocity field was required to be either
time-independent or time-periodic. In the present study, we develop an approach
to identify prominent one-way barriers based only on fluid velocity data over a
finite time interval, which may have arbitrary time-dependence. We call such a
barrier a burning Lagrangian coherent structure (bLCS) in analogy to Lagrangian
coherent structures (LCSs) commonly used in passive advection. Our approach is
based on the variational formulation of LCSs using curves of stationary
""Lagrangian shear"", introduced by Farazmand, Blazevski, and Haller [Physica D

fluid and the structure are fully coupled via interface conditions prescribing
the continuity of the velocities at the fluid-structure interface and the

including certain non-hydrodynamic degrees of freedom, in particular
anisotropic components of the pressure tensor, in the theoretical description.
We show that, using this method, it is possible to describe the crossover from
fluid dynamics to ballistic expansion locally. We illustrate the use of
anisotropic fluid dynamics by studying the expansion of the dilute Fermi gas at
unitarity using different functional forms of the shear viscosity, including a
shear viscosity which is solely a function of temperature, $\eta\sim

Heterophase fluctuations at the gas-liquid phase transition,http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04956v1,['A. S. Bakai'],"  The problem of the gas-liquid heterophase fluctuations of a fluid within the
critical and supercritical regions is revisited. To describe the thermodynamics
and structure of the heterophase fluid, the mesoscopic equation of state is
deduced. The mesoscopic scale is connected with the sizes of the mixed bubbles
and droplets (g-fluctuons and l-fluctuons). The two-component order parameter
of the heterophase fluid describes the gas-like and liquid-like fractions. Its
interconnection with the van der Waals order parameter is ascertained. The
non-symmetric Ising-type equation of state of the heterophase fluid is analyzed
using the standard methods. The manifestations of the mesoscopic effects in the
structural and thermodynamic properties of the fluid are investigated. The
domain of applicability of a classical model is found using the mesoscopic
Ornstein-Zernike equation. The asymmetry and non-analyticity of the diameter of
the phase coexistence curve is researched. It is shown that that the critical
non-analyticity of the diameter is induced by the mesoscopic heterophase
fluctuations. The percolation thresholds of the droplets and bubbles in the
critical and supercritical fluid are determined. On the phase diagrams they
bound the domains of applicability of the droplet model.

Numerical results obtained show relatively small dependence of self-similar

current, and use it to study gauge and gravitational anomalies in Galilean
theories coupled to torsional Newton-Cartan backgrounds. We establish that the
relativistic anomaly inflow mechanism with an appropriately modified anomaly
polynomial, can be used to generate these anomalies. Similar to relativistic
case, we find that Galilean anomalies also survive only in even dimensions.
Further, these anomalies only effect the gauge and rotational symmetries of a
Galilean theory; in particular the Milne boost symmetry remains non-anomalous.
We also extend the transgression machinery used in relativistic fluids to
fluids on null backgrounds, and use it to determine how these anomalies affect
the constitutive relations of a Galilean fluid.
  Unrelated to Galilean fluids, we propose an analogue of the off-shell second
law of thermodynamics for relativistic fluids introduced by [arXiv:1106.0277],

Interestingly, we find that even in absense of spin and torsion the entropy

An introduction to linear poroelasticity,http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04274v1,['Andi Merxhani'],"  This study is an introduction to the theory of three-dimensional
consolidation. The point of departure in the description are the basic
equations of elasticity (i.e. constitutive law, equations of equilibrium in
terms of stresses, and the definition of strain), together with the principle
of effective stress, and the law of Darcy for fluid flow in porous media. These
equations, together with the principle of mass conservation, are the only
premises used to derive a drained description of consolidation theory. Next,
the increment of fluid content is defined and its constitutive law is derived -
with its derivation following naturally from the equation of fluid mass
balance. Pore pressure, storage, and undrained coefficients are also introduced
and useful relations are proven. Where appropriate, the physical meaning of
these coefficients is proven mathematically. Equations of equilibrium and fluid
mass conservation are subsequently expressed in terms of the increment of fluid
content and undrained coefficients, leading to an undrained description of
consolidation theory. Thus the initial approach of using drained description is
extended to the formalism of Rice and Cleary. This approach to
three-dimensional consolidation is useful for its simplicity. It does not
require the ad-hoc definition of constants and that of an elastic energy
potential. Instead, it is a direct extension to linear elasticity that accounts

velocity at the position of a particle is determined by interpolation, such
that a Stokes friction force gives rise to an exchange of momentum between the
particle and the surrounding fluid nodes. For efficiency reasons, the LB time
step is chosen as a multiple of the MD time step, such that the MD system is
updated more frequently than the LB fluid. In this situation, there are
different ways to implement the coupling: Either the fluid velocity at the
surrounding nodes is only updated every LB time step, or it is updated every MD
step. It is demonstrated that the latter choice, which enforces momentum
conservation on a significantly shorter time scale, is clearly superior in
terms of stability and accuracy, and nevertheless only marginally slower in
terms of execution speed. The second variant is therefore the recommended

Fluid Dynamics far from Local Equilibrium,http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08699v3,['Paul Romatschke'],"  Fluid dynamics is traditionally thought to apply only to systems near local
equilibrium. In this case, the effective theory of fluid dynamics can be
constructed as a gradient series. Recent applications of resurgence suggest
that this gradient series diverges, but can be Borel-resummed, giving rise to a
hydrodynamic attractor solution which is well defined even for large gradients.
Arbitrary initial data quickly approaches this attractor via non-hydrodynamic
mode decay. This suggests the existence of a new theory of far-from-equilibrium
fluid dynamics. In this work, the framework of fluid dynamics far from local
equilibrium for conformal system is introduced, and the hydrodynamic attractor
solutions for rBRSSS, kinetic theory in the relaxation time approximation, and
strongly-coupled N=4 SYM are identified for a system undergoing Bjorken flow.

Hybrid models for complex fluids with multipolar interactions,http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.4389v2,['Cesare Tronci'],"  Multipolar order in complex fluids is described by statistical correlations.
This paper presents a novel dynamical approach, which accounts for microscopic
effects on the order parameter space. Indeed, the order parameter field is
replaced by a statistical distribution function that is carried by the fluid
flow. Inspired by Doi's model of colloidal suspensions, the present theory is
derived from a hybrid moment closure for Yang-Mills Vlasov plasmas. This hybrid
formulation is constructed under the assumption that inertial effects dominate
over dissipative phenomena, so that the total energy is conserved. After
presenting the basic geometric properties of the theory, the effect of
Yang-Mills fields is considered and a direct application is presented to
magnetized fluids with quadrupolar order (spin nematic phases). Hybrid models
are also formulated for complex fluids with symmetry breaking. For the special

Dynamic high pressure: Why it makes metallic fluid hydrogen,http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2899v1,['W. J. Nellis'],"  Metallic fluid H has been made by dynamic compression decades after Wigner

experimentally is within a few percent of the density predicted by WH. Metallic
fluid H was achieved by multiple-shock compression of liquid H2, which
compression is quasi-isentropic and H is thermally equilibrated in experiments
with 100 ns lifetimes. Quasi-isentropic means compressions are isentropic but
with sufficient temperature and entropy to drive a crossover from liquid H2 to
degenerate fluid H at 9-fold compression and pressure P=140 GPa (1.4 Mbar). The
metallic fluid is highly degenerate: T/TF 0.014, where temperature T=3000 K and
Fermi temperature TF =220,000 K, respectively, at metallization density 0.64
mol H/cm3.

hydrodynamics, the basic ideas of which were developed in the Nineteenth
Century in European universities. Today dynamic compression is generally
unfamiliar to the scientific community. The purposes of this paper are to
present a brief review of (i) dynamic compression and its affects on materials,

discover an unexpected transition separating two distinct regimes where the

Morphology of soft and slippery contact via fluid drainage,http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10837v1,"['Yumo Wang', 'Joelle Frechette']","  The dynamic of contact formation between soft materials immersed in a fluid
is accompanied by fluid drainage and elastic deformation. As a result,
controlling the coupling between lubrication pressure and elasticity provides
strategies to design materials with reversible and dynamic adhesion to wet or
flooded surfaces. We characterize the elastic deformation of a soft coating
with nanometer-scale roughness as it approaches and contacts a rigid surface in
a fluid environment. The lubrication pressure during the approach causes
elastic deformation and prevents contact formation. We observe deformation
profiles that are drastically different from those observed for elastic
half-space when the thickness of the soft coating is comparable to the
hydrodynamic radius. In contrast, we show that surface roughness favors fluid
drainage without altering the elastic deformation. As a result, the coupling
between elasticity and slip (caused by surface roughness) can lead to trapped
fluid pockets in the contact region.

useful features including the ability to model solids with sharp corners and
the ability to model actuated solids. The latter permits the simulation of

In each geometry, we calculate the growth rate of sinusoidal modes of

at long wavelength, one corresponds to the deformation of the interface, and

The passive cases of the film and the spherical droplet are always stable. For

diffusion-transport, characterized by the nondimensional Pecl\'et number, is
moderate ($\text{Pe}\approx 10$). These changes are correlated to significant
increases in the pressure force on the surface of the squirmer. The swimming

verify that the model exhibits desired fluid-structure behaviors, we make a few

fluctuation kinetics in the standard Vlasov theory, the same method is applied
to the drift-kinetic equation from Littlejohn's theory of guiding-center
motion. This process sheds a new light on drift-ordered fluid (drift-fluid)
models, whose anisotropic pressure tensor is then considered in detail. In
addition, current drift-fluid models are completed by the insertion of
magnetization terms ensuring momentum conservation. Magnetization currents are
also shown to lead to challenging aspects when drift-fluid models are coupled
to Maxwell's equations for the evolution of the electromagnetic field. In order
to overcome these difficulties, a simplified guiding-center theory is proposed
along with its possible applications to hybrid kinetic-fluid models.

instabilities occur in all cases, except for fluids with Galilean boost
symmetry combined with the choice of macroscopic variables called Eckart frame.
We also present a complete linearised analysis of the full spectrum of first

evidence that the unphysical instabilities are symptoms of first order
hydrodynamics, rather than a special feature of Lorentzian fluids.

static properties of simple fluids under confinement, a theory of comparative
accuracy for the transport coefficients has yet to emerge. Nonetheless, there
is evidence that knowledge of how confinement modifies static behavior can aid
in forecasting dynamics. Specifically, molecular simulation studies have shown
that the relationship between excess entropy and self diffusivity of a bulk
equilibrium fluid changes only modestly when the fluid is isothermally
confined, indicating that knowledge of the former might allow semi-quantitative
predictions of the latter. Do other static measures, such as those that
characterize free or available volume, also strongly correlate with
single-particle dynamics of confined fluids? Here, we study this issue for both
the single-component hard-sphere fluid and hard-sphere mixtures. Specifically,
we use molecular simulations and fundamental measure theory to study these
systems at approximately $10^3$ equilibrium state points. We examine three
different confining geometries (slit pore, square channel, and cylindrical
pore) and the effects of packing fraction and particle-boundary interactions.
Although density fails to predict some key qualitative trends for the dynamics
of confined fluids, we find that a new generalized measure of available volume
for inhomogeneous fluids strongly correlates with the self diffusivity across a
wide parameter space in these systems, approximately independent of the degree
of confinement. An important consequence, which we demonstrate here, is that
density functional theory predictions of this static property can be used
together with knowledge of bulk fluid behavior to estimate the diffusion
coefficient of confined fluids under equilibrium conditions.

Anomalous structure and dynamics of the Gaussian-core fluid,http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.3169v2,"['William P. Krekelberg', 'Tanuj Kumar', 'Jeetain Mittal', 'Jeffrey R. Errington', 'Thomas M. Truskett']","  It is known that there are thermodynamic states for which the Gaussian-core
(GC) fluid displays anomalous properties such as expansion upon isobaric
cooling (density anomaly) and increased single-particle mobility upon
isothermal compression (self-diffusivity anomaly). We investigate how
temperature and density affect its short-range translational structural order,
as characterized by the two-body excess entropy. We find that there is a wide
range of conditions for which the short-range translational order of the GC
fluid decreases upon isothermal compression (structural order anomaly). The
origin of the structural anomaly is qualitatively similar to that of other
anomalous fluids and is connected to how compression affects static
correlations at different length scales. We find that the self-diffusivity of
the GC fluid obeys a scaling relationship with the two-body excess entropy that
is very similar to the one observed for a variety of simple liquids. One
consequence of this relationship is that the state points for which structural,
self-diffusivity, and density anomalies of the Gaussian-core fluid occur appear
as cascading regions on the temperature-density plane, a phenomenon observed
earlier for models of waterlike fluids. There are, however, key differences
between the anomalies of GC and waterlike fluids, and we discuss how those can
be qualitatively understood by considering the respective interparticle
potentials of these models. Finally, we note that the self-diffusivity of the
Gaussian-core fluid obeys different scaling laws depending on whether the
two-body or total excess entropy is considered. This finding, which deserves
more comprehensive future study, appears to underscore the significance of
higher-body correlations for the behavior of fluids with bounded interactions.

Noncommutative fluid dynamics in the KÃ¤hler parametrization,http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.1688v2,"['L. Holender', 'M. A. Santos', 'M. T. D. Orlando', 'I. V. Vancea']","  In this paper, we propose a first order action functional for a large class
of systems that generalize the relativistic perfect fluids in the K\""{a}hler
parametrization to noncommutative spacetimes. We calculate the equations of
motion for the fluid potentials and the energy-momentum tensor in the first
order in the noncommutative parameter. The density current does not receive any
noncommutative corrections and it is conserved under the action of the
commutative generators $P_{\mu}$ but the energy-momentum tensor is not.
Therefore, we determine the set of constraints under which the energy-momentum
tensor is divergenceless. Another set of constraints on the fluid potentials is
obtained from the requirement of the invariance of the action under the
generalization of the volume preserving transformations of the noncommutative
spacetime. We show that the proposed action describes noncommutative fluid
models by casting the energy-momentum tensor in the familiar fluid form and
identifying the corresponding energy and momentum densities. In the commutative
limit, they are identical to the corresponding quantities of the relativistic
perfect fluids. The energy-momentum tensor contains a dissipative term that is
due to the noncommutative spacetime and vanishes in the commutative limit.
Finally, we particularize the theory to the case when the complex fluid
potentials are characterized by a function $K(z,\bar{z})$ that is a deformation
of the complex plane and show that this model has important common features
with the commutative fluid such as infinitely many conserved currents and a
conserved axial current that in the commutative case is associated to the
topologically conserved linking number.

"Do the Navier-Stokes equations embody all physics in a flow of Newtonian
  fluids?",http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6562v5,"['Qifeng Lv', 'Sijing Wang']","  The Navier-Stokes equations are the governing equations of fluid flows. They
are deemed to embody all physics in a flow of Newtonian fluids like water,
especially when we assume the fluid is incompressible. Fluid flows are usually
described in the Eulerian perspective wherein we focus on the fluid's
quantities at a fixed point in space as time processes, rather than the motion
of each individual particle. The latter perspective is indeed the Lagrangian
perspective which is widely used in solid mechanics like elasticity. Thus, the
Navier-Stokes equations should be and indeed they are always used in the
Eulerian perspective. Here we show the right-hand sides of the Navier-Stokes
equations were derived not in the Eulerian perspective but rather in the
Lagrangian perspective, because the strain rates used in the derivation were
the Lagrangian Cauchy strain rates. Thus, for describing fluid flows in the
Eulerian perspective, the Navier-Stokes equations may lost some physics. To
make it sure, we put the Cauchy strain into the material derivative, and then
derive the Eulerian Cauchy strain rates. We find the difference between the
Eulerian and the Lagrangian Cauchy strain rates is significant when in a
turbulent flow. Therefore, On the basis of the Eulerian Cauchy strain rates, we
derive a new set of governing equations for the flow of Newtonian fluids. The
newly derived governing equations are fully in the Eulerian perspective. We
believe they are the real equations that Navier, Cauchy, Poisson and Stokes
intended to find for the viscous flow of Newtonian fluids.

states in a single-component fluid. It is either found or predicted, usually at
extreme conditions, for a broad group of very different substances, including
helium, carbon, silicon, phosphorous, sulfur,tellurium, cerium, hydrogen and
tin tetraiodide. This phenomenon is also hypothesized for metastable and deeply
supercooled water, presumably located a few degrees below the experimental
limit of homogeneous ice formation. We present a generic phenomenological
approach to describe polyamorphism in a single-component fluid, which is
completely independent of the molecular origin of the phenomenon. We show that
fluid polyamorphism may occur either in the presence or the absence of fluid
phase separation depending on the symmetry of the order parameter. In the
latter case, it is associated with a second-order transition, such as in liquid
helium or liquid sulfur. To specify the phenomenology, we consider a fluid with
thermodynamic equilibrium between two distinct interconvertible states or
molecular structures. A fundamental signature of this concept is the
identification of the equilibrium fraction of molecules involved in each of
these alternative states. However, the existence of the alternative structures
may result in polyamorphic fluid phase separation only if mixing of these
structures is not ideal. The two-state thermodynamics unifies all the debated
scenarios of fluid polyamorphism in different areas of condensed-matter
physics, with or without phase separation, and even goes beyond the phenomenon
of polyamorphism by generically describing the anomalous properties of fluids

Dynamics of Mixed Convective--Stably-Stratified Fluids,http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06454v1,"['L. -A. Couston', 'D. Lecoanet', 'B. Favier', 'M. Le Bars']","  We study the dynamical regimes of a density-stratified fluid confined between
isothermal no-slip top and bottom boundaries (at temperatures $T_t$ and $T_b$)
via direct numerical simulation. The thermal expansion coefficient of the fluid
is temperature dependent and chosen such that the fluid density is maximum at
the inversion temperature $T_b>T_i>T_t$. Thus, the lower layer of the fluid is
convectively unstable while the upper layer is stably stratified. We show that
the characteristics of the convection change significantly depending on the
degree of stratification of the stable layer. For strong stable stratification,
the convection zone coincides with the fraction of the fluid that is
convectively unstable (i.e. where $T>T_i$), and convective motions consist of
rising and sinking plumes of large density anomaly, as is the case in canonical
Rayleigh-Benard convection; internal gravity waves are generated by turbulent
fluctuations in the convective layer and propagate in the upper layer. For weak
stable stratification, we demonstrate that a large fraction of the stable fluid
(i.e. with temperature $T<T_i$) is instead destabilized and entrained by
buoyant plumes emitted from the bottom boundary. The convection thus mixes cold
patches of low density-anomaly fluid with hot upward plumes, and the end result
is that the $T_i$ isotherm sinks within the bottom boundary layer and that the
convection is entrainment-dominated. We provide a phenomenological description
of the transition between the regimes of plume-dominated and
entrainment-dominated convection through analysis of quantities for different
stratification strengths. We find that the effect of the stable layer on the
convection decreases only weakly with increasing stratification strength,
meaning that the dynamics of the stable layer and convection should be studied
self-consistently in a wide range of applications.

complicated by contact constraints and potentially complex geometrical features
of contacting surfaces. We develop a monolithic finite-element framework for
handling contact, thin incompressible viscous flow and fluid-induced tractions
on the surface of the solid, suitable for both one- and two-way coupling
approaches. Additionally, we consider fluid entrapment in ""pools"" delimited by
contact patches and its pressurisation following a non-linear compressible
constitutive law. Image analysis algorithms are adopted to identify the local
status of each interface element (i.e. distinguish between contact, fluid flow

application of the proposed framework for a problem with a model geometry is
given, and the robustness is demonstrated by the DOF-wise and status-wise

Fast Turbulent Reconnection,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0002067v1,"['A. Lazarian', 'E. Vishniac']","  Reconnection is the process by which magnetic fields in a conducting fluid
change their topology. This process is essential for understanding a wide
variety of astrophysical processes, including stellar and galactic dynamos and
astrophysical turbulence. To account for solar flares, solar cycles and the
structure of the galactic magnetic field reconnection must be fast, propagating
with a speed close to the Alfven speed. We show that the presence of a random
magnetic field component substantially enhances the reconnection rate and
enables fast reconnection, i.e. reconnection that does not depend on fluid
resistivity. The enhancement of the reconnection rate is achieved via a
combination of two effects. First of all, only small segments of magnetic field
lines are subject to direct Ohmic annihilation. Thus the fraction of magnetic
energy that goes directly into fluid heating goes to zero as fluid resistivity
vanishes. However, the most important enhancement comes from the fact that
unlike the laminar fluid case where reconnection is constrained to proceed line
by line, the presence of turbulence enables many magnetic field lines to enter
the reconnection zone simultaneously. A significant fraction of magnetic energy
goes into MHD turbulence and this enhances reconnection rates through an
increase in the field stochasticity. In this way magnetic reconnection becomes
fast when field stochasticity is accounted for. As a consequence solar and
galactic dynamos are also fast, i.e. do not depend on fluid resistivity.

with (i) formulation of tensor virial equations from the standpoint of

motions for virial equilibrium configurations; (iii) extent to which systematic
and random motions are equivalent in changing a fluid shape. The tensor virial
equations are formulated using analytical mechanics, and the self
potential-energy tensor is shown to be symmetric. The role of systematic and
random motions in collisionless, ideal, self-gravitating fluids, is analysed in
detail including radial and tangential velocity dispersion on the equatorial
plane. R3 fluids are defined as ideal, self-gravitating fluids in virial
equilibrium, with systematic rotation around a principal axis of inertia, and
ihe related virial equations are formulated. A unified theory of systematic and
random motions is developed for R3 fluids, taking into consideration imaginary
rotation. The effect of random motion excess is shown to be equivalent to an
additional real or imaginary rotation, respectively, inducing flattening or
elongation. R3 fluids are found to admit adjoint configurations with isotropic
random velocity distribution. Further constraints are established on the amount
of random velocity anisotropy along the principal axes, for triaxial
configurations. A necessary condition is formulated for the occurrence of
bifurcation points from axisymmetric to triaxial configurations in virial
equilibrium, which is independent of the anisotropy parameters. In the special
case of homeoidally striated Jacobi ellipsoid, some previously known results

occurrence of long-ranged orientational order, and the structural properties of
dipolar fluids. As a model system we consider the Stockmayer fluid that
consists of spherical particles interacting via a Lennard-Jones potential plus
dipolar forces. For sufficiently strong dipole moments one finds a region where
a fluid phase with long-ranged orientational order is stable. For all sample
shapes with the exception of a long thin needle this phase exhibits a spatially
inhomogeneous magnetization which depends on the actual shape. We determine the
details of the magnetization structure in a cubic sample in the absence and in
the presence of an external magnetic field. One obtains a vortexlike structure
with an escape of the magnetization into the axis direction near the vortex
axis and two point defects where the absolute value of the magnetization is
strongly reduced. If the spherical cores of the particles are replaced by
elongated or oblate shapes a nematic phase without spontaneous magnetization is
also possible due to the anisotropic steric interactions. We study the
interplay of this nematic ordering with ferromagnetism in fluids of dipolar
hard ellipsoids. Orientational order arises locally in the isotropic fluid
phases near the liquid-gas interface of the Stockmayer fluid.
Density-functional theory allows us to determine density and orientational
order profiles as well as the surface tension of this interface.

Freezing in this mixture reveals that at least the phase rich in large cubes

This proposal is confirmed by an explicit weakly nonlinear stability analysis

for the critical amplitude of velocity perturbations beyond which the flow is
nonlinearly unstable, and for the wavelength of the mode whose critical
amplitude is smallest. The nonlinear instability sets in quite abruptly at
Weissenberg numbers around 4 in the planar case and about 5.2 in the
cylindrical case, so that for Weissenberg numbers somewhat larger than these
values perturbations of the order of a few percent in the wall shear stress
suffice to make the flow unstable. We have suggested elsewhere that this
nonlinear instability could be an important intrinsic route to melt fracture

physics, because (in common with other methods) lattice Boltzmann cannot fully
resolve the hierarchy of length, energy and time scales that arise in typical
flows of complex fluids. Care is needed in deciding what physics to resolve and
what to leave unresolved, particularly when colloidal particles are present in
one or both of two fluid phases. This influences steering of simulation

geometry of the simulation box may be needed; an example of this, relating to
our study of the effect of colloidal particles on the Rayleigh-Plateau

interfaces. Then we discuss general complex fluids. We show also that, when the
entropy and the total enthalpy are constant throughout the flow, vorticity may
be generated by the inhomogeneous character of the distribution of material

discuss also some aspects of unsteady motion and show that in two-dimensional
flows of incompressible perfect complex fluids the vorticity is in general not
conserved, due to a mechanism of transfer of energy between different levels.

"An investigation into the vortex formation in a turbulent fluid with an
  application in tropical storm generation",http://arxiv.org/abs/nlin/0310045v1,['Kaushik Majumdar'],"  The present work discusses about a possible physical interpretation of the
occurrence of turbulence in a dynamic fluid with mathematical modeling and
computer simulation. Here turbulence is defined to be a phenomenon of random
velocity field in the space-time continuum accompanied by chaotic occurrence of
vortices. This interpretation is independent of the Navier-Stokes equations. I
have reasoned how individual fluid percels are disintegrated with increasing
Reynolds number (Re) (or increasing velocity or decreasing viscosity or both)
leading to creation of smaller parcels with arbitrary speeds in arbitrary
directions, which destroys the laminar structure of the fluid flow. I have
modeled the occurrence of a vortex as a result of collision among fluid jets
under certain conditions. Chaotic occurrence of such vortices further
randomizes the velocity field. These together ultimately lead to turbulence. I
have also shown an application of vortex formation in a dynamic fluid in
atmospheric science., where it has been shown how an initial dusturbing
cyclonic vortex is created by collision between two linear wind jets under
certain conditions, which under favorable conditions, may mature into a severe
tropical storm. Then a three dimensional mathematical modeling of the vortex
(assuming that it is going to become a matured storm) has been proposed with
computer simulations. This helps us to understand the mystery of origin of
cyclonic and anticyclonic vortices in atmosphere and some of their observed
asymmetries.

"Compressibility effects on the Rayleigh-Taylor instability growth
  between immiscible fluids",http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0310072v1,['Daniel Livescu'],"  The linearized Navier-Stokes equations for a system of superposed immiscible
compressible ideal fluids are analyzed. The results of the analysis reconcile
the stabilizing and destabilizing effects of compressibility reported in the
literature. It is shown that the growth rate $n$ obtained for an inviscid,
compressible flow in an infinite domain is bounded by the growth rates obtained
for the corresponding incompressible flows with uniform and exponentially
varying density. As the equilibrium pressure at the interface $p_\infty$
increases (less compressible flow), $n$ increases towards the uniform density
result, while as the ratio of specific heats $\gamma$ increases (less
compressible fluid), $n$ decreases towards the exponentially varying density
incompressible flow result. This remains valid in the presence of surface
tension or for viscous fluids and the validity of the results is also discussed
for finite size domains. The critical wavenumber imposed by the presence of
surface tension is unaffected by compressibility. However, the results show
that the surface tension modifies the sensitivity of the growth rate to a
differential change in $\gamma$ for the lower and upper fluids. For the viscous
case, the linearized equations are solved numerically for different values of
$p_\infty$ and $\gamma$. It is found that the largest differences compared with
the incompressible cases are obtained at small Atwood numbers. The most
unstable mode for the compressible case is also bounded by the most unstable
modes corresponding to the two limiting incompressible cases.

simulation of biological tissues and morphogenesis. Both tissue physiology and
morphogenesis depend on diffusion of chemical morphogens in the extra-cellular
fluid or matrix (ECM). Standard diffusion solvers applied to the cellular potts
model use finite difference methods on the underlying CPM lattice. However,
these methods produce a diffusing field tied to the underlying lattice, which
is inaccurate in many biological situations in which cell or ECM movement
causes advection rapid compared to diffusion. Finite difference schemes suffer
numerical instabilities solving the resulting advection-diffusion equations. To
circumvent these problems we simulate advection-diffusion within the framework
of the CPM using off-lattice finite-difference methods. We define a set of
generalized fluid particles which detach advection and diffusion from the
lattice. Diffusion occurs between neighboring fluid particles by local
averaging rules which approximate the Laplacian. Directed spin flips in the CPM
handle the advective movement of the fluid particles. A constraint on relative
velocities in the fluid explicitly accounts for fluid viscosity. We use the CPM
to solve various diffusion examples including multiple instantaneous sources,
continuous sources, moving sources and different boundary geometries and
conditions to validate our approximation against analytical and established
numerical solutions. We also verify the CPM results for Poiseuille flow and
Taylor-Aris dispersion.

"Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics and Hydrodynamics for a Granular
  Fluid",http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.3714v1,['James W. Dufty'],"  Granular fluids consist of collections of activated mesoscopic or macroscopic
particles (e.g., powders or grains) whose flows often appear similar to those
of normal fluids. To explore the qualitative and quantitative description of
these flows an idealized model for such fluids, a system of smooth inelastic
hard spheres, is considered. The single feature distinguishing granular and
normal fluids being explored in this way is the inelasticity of collisions. The
dominant differences observed in real granular fluids are indeed captured by
this feature. Following a brief introductory description of real granular
fluids and motivation for the idealized model, the elements of nonequilibrium
statistical mechanics are recalled (observables, states, and their dynamics).
Peculiarities of the hard sphere interactions are developed in detail. The
exact microscopic balance equations for the number, energy, and momentum
densities are derived and their averages described as the origin for a possible
macroscopic continuum mechanics description. This formally exact analysis leads
to closed, macroscopic hydrodynamic equations through the notion of a ""normal""
state. This concept is introduced and the Navier-Stokes constitutive equations
are derived, with associated Green-Kubo expressions for the transport
coefficients. A parallel description of granular gases is described in the
context of kinetic theory, and the Boltzmann limit is identified critically.
The construction of the ""normal"" solution to the kinetic equation is outlined,
and Navier-Stokes order hydrodynamic equations are re-derived for a low density
granular gas.

photon rocket in a cosmological background are obtained by performing the same
conformal transformation as is used to obtain the Robertson-Walker metric from
Minkowski spacetime. In the case of the cosmological radiating stellar
exterior, a two-fluid solution is found that obeys all of the energy conditions
and consists of a null fluid and a perfect fluid that asymptotically falls off
to the standard cosmological values for pressure and density at infinite
radius. For the cosmological photon rocket, the massless case is first
interpreted to obtain a solution for an accelerating cosmological reference
frame, and then the general case is interpreted: in both cases, a two-fluid
solution is found that consists of a null fluid and an imperfect fluid that
possesses heat conduction and anisotropic stress. The imperfect fluid appears
to contain an inhomogeneous dark energy component that acts to accelerate the
matter through space via a pressure gradient, but this component has negative
energy density on the trailing side of the rocket, meaning only the leading
side of the rocket is guaranteed to satisfy the weak and dominant energy
conditions. Unlike spacetimes that have rotation but no acceleration, the
cosmological photon rocket can serve as an example of a spacetime that
contradicts Mach's notion of acceleration, since an observer would see
empirical evidence of acceleration even though the matter does not accelerate

the Lagrangian and the Eulerian descriptions but is crucial for numerous
problems concerned with the interaction between a compliant wall and a viscous

shed some light on the stability behaviour in compression of the solid

that the usual technique of seeking standing waves solutions is not appropriate

reveals that the presence of a viscous fluid makes a compressed neo-Hookean

A viscoelastic deadly fluid in carnivorous pitcher plants,http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.4724v1,"['Laurence Gaume', 'YoÃ«l Forterre']","  Background : The carnivorous plants of the genus Nepenthes, widely
distributed in the Asian tropics, rely mostly on nutrients derived from
arthropods trapped in their pitcher-shaped leaves and digested by their
enzymatic fluid. The genus exhibits a great diversity of prey and pitcher forms
and its mechanism of trapping has long intrigued scientists. The slippery inner
surfaces of the pitchers, which can be waxy or highly wettable, have so far
been considered as the key trapping devices. However, the occurrence of species
lacking such epidermal specializations but still effective at trapping insects
suggests the possible implication of other mechanisms. Methodology/Principal
Findings : Using a combination of insect bioassays, high-speed video and
rheological measurements, we show that the digestive fluid of Nepenthes
rafflesiana is highly viscoelastic and that this physical property is crucial
for the retention of insects in its traps. Trapping efficiency is shown to
remain strong even when the fluid is highly diluted by water, as long as the
elastic relaxation time of the fluid is higher than the typical time scale of
insect movements. Conclusions/Significance : This finding challenges the common
classification of Nepenthes pitchers as simple passive traps and is of great
adaptive significance for these tropical plants, which are often submitted to
high rainfalls and variations in fluid concentration. The viscoelastic trap
constitutes a cryptic but potentially widespread adaptation of Nepenthes
species and could be a homologous trait shared through common ancestry with the
sundew (Drosera) flypaper plants. Such large production of a highly
viscoelastic biopolymer fluid in permanent pools is nevertheless unique in the
plant kingdom and suggests novel applications for pest control.

traveling front solution is obtained from a generalized traveling wave
assumption. This solution is, in an overall sense, equivalent to the Taylor
shock solution of the Burgers equation. However, in contrast to the Burgers
equation, the model equation considered here is capable to describe waves
propagating in opposite directions. Owing to the Hamiltonian structure of the
proposed model equation, the front solution is in agreement with the classical
Rankine-Hugoniot relations. The exact front solution propagates at supersonic
speed with respect to the fluid ahead of it, and subsonic speed with respect to
the fluid behind it, similarly to the fluid dynamical shock. Linear stability
analysis reveals that the front is stable when the acoustic pressure belongs to
a critical interval, and is otherwise unstable. These results are verified
numerically. Studies of head-on colliding fronts demonstrate that the front
propagation speed changes upon collision.

sheet include: constant mass per unit area; small but finite flexural rigidity;
varying aspect ratios from within the range 0.43<l/L<1, where L and l denote

drag coefficient is observed to decrease with increasing aspect ratio and
Reynolds number. In the presence of tension, the fluid drag is significantly
reduced in the region below the critical flow velocity at which convected wave
instabilities appear. This critical flow velocity can be increased through the
moderate application of in-plane tension. Under lateral tension, the drag of
the sheet is given to good approximation by the turbulent boundary layer drag
law for a flat plate. Once stability is lost, however, the drag coefficient
increases rapidly with Reynolds number due to convected waves travelling over

their study difficult or impossible. A novel technique to measure the dynamical
properties of fluid-fluid interfaces have developed accordingly. We

viscosity are qualitatively different from the dynamics arising from the bulk

find that for small vesicles the membrane dissipation dominates, with a
relaxation time that scales as the size of the vesicle to the power 2. For
large vesicles, the bulk dissipation dominates, and the exponent in the

prescribing forms for the specific Helmholtz potential and the rate of
dissipation, we derive the relations for the partial stress in the solid, the

cluster of particles lie above the clear fluid, particles will detach from the
lower boundary of the cluster and form an unstable separation front giving rise
to growing fingers of falling particles. We study this problem using both
experiments and hybrid granular/fluid mechanics models. In the case of
particles from 50 to 500 microns in diameter falling in air, we study the
horizontal density fluctuations at early times: the amplitude of the density
difference between two points at a certain horizontal distance grows as a power
law of time. This happens up to a saturation corresponding to a power law of
the distance. The way in which the correlation length builds up to this
saturation also follows a power law of time. We show that these decompaction
fronts in sedimentation problems follow a Family-Vicsek scaling, characterize
the dynamic and Hurst exponent of the lateral density fluctuations,
respectively z \sim 1 and \zeta \sim 0.75, and show how the prefactors depend
on the grain diameter. We also show from similar simulations with a more
viscous and incompressible fluid, that this feature is independent of the fluid
compressibility or viscosity, ranging from air to water/glycerol mixtures.

Self-propulsion in viscoelastic fluids: pushers vs. pullers,http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0123v1,"['Lailai Zhu', 'Eric Lauga', 'Luca Brandt']","  We use numerical simulations to address locomotion at zero Reynolds number in
viscoelastic (Giesekus) fluids. The swimmers are assumed to be spherical, to
self-propel using tangential surface deformation, and the computations are
implemented using a finite element method. The emphasis of the study is on the
change of the swimming kinematics, energetics, and flow disturbance from
Newtonian to viscoelastic, and on the distinction between pusher and puller
swimmers. In all cases, the viscoelastic swimming speed is below the Newtonian
one, with a minimum obtained for intermediate values of the Weissenberg number,
$We$. An analysis of the flow field places the origin of this swimming
degradation in non-Newtonian elongational stresses. The power required for
swimming is also systematically below the Newtonian power, and always a
decreasing function of $We$. A detail energetic balance of the swimming problem
points at the polymeric part of the stress as the primary $We$-decreasing
energetic contribution, while the contributions of the work done by the swimmer
from the solvent remain essentially $We$-independent. In addition, we observe
negative values of the polymeric power density in some flow regions, indicating
positive elastic work by the polymers on the fluid. The hydrodynamic
efficiency, defined as the ratio of the useful to total rate of work, is always
above the Newtonian case, with a maximum relative value obtained at
intermediate Weissenberg numbers. Finally, the presence of polymeric stresses
leads to an increase of the rate of decay of the flow velocity in the fluid,
and a decrease of the magnitude of the stresslet governing the magnitude of the
effective bulk stress in the fluid.

point-like 'blob' particles immersed in an incompressible fluid, generalizing
previous work for compressible fluids. The coupling consistently includes
excess (positive or negative) inertia of the particles relative to the
displaced fluid, and accounts for thermal fluctuations in the fluid momentum
equation. The coupling between the fluid and the blob is based on a no-slip
constraint equating the particle velocity with the local average of the fluid
velocity, and conserves momentum and energy. We demonstrate that the
formulation obeys a fluctuation-dissipation balance, owing to the
non-dissipative nature of the no-slip coupling. We develop a spatio-temporal
discretization that preserves, as best as possible, these properties of the
continuum formulation. In the spatial discretization, the local averaging and
spreading operations are accomplished using compact kernels commonly used in
immersed boundary methods. We find that the special properties of these kernels
make the discrete blob a particle with surprisingly physically-consistent
volume, mass, and hydrodynamic properties. We develop a second-order
semi-implicit temporal integrator that maintains discrete
fluctuation-dissipation balance, and is not limited in stability by viscosity.
Furthermore, the temporal scheme requires only constant-coefficient Poisson and
Helmholtz linear solvers, enabling a very efficient and simple FFT-based

channel flows of viscoelastic fluids is examined by analyzing the frequency
responses from spatio-temporal body forces to the velocity and polymer stress

streamwise length scales may be significantly amplified even in the absence of
inertia. For fluctuations without streamwise variations, we derive explicit
analytical expressions for the dependence of the worst-case amplification (from
different forcing to different velocity and polymer stress components) on the
Weissenberg number ($We$), the maximum extensibility of the polymer chains
($L$), the viscosity ratio, and the spanwise wavenumber. For the Oldroyd-B
model, the amplification of the most energetic components of velocity and
polymer stress fields scales as $We^2$ and $We^4$. On the other hand, finite
extensibility of polymer molecules limits the largest achievable amplification
even in flows with infinitely large Weissenberg numbers: in the presence of
wall-normal and spanwise forces the amplification of the streamwise velocity
and polymer stress fluctuations is bounded by quadratic and quartic functions
of $L$. This high amplification signals low robustness to modeling
imperfections of inertialess channel flows of viscoelastic fluids. The
underlying physical mechanism involves interactions of polymer stress
fluctuations with a base shear, and it represents a close analog of the lift-up

particles with arbitrary acoustic contrast factor. The IC method is based on a
Eulerian-Lagrangian approach: particles move in continuum space while the fluid
equations are solved in a regular mesh (here we use the finite volume method).
Thermal fluctuations in the fluid stress, important below the micron scale, are
also taken into account following the Landau-Lifshitz fluid description. Each
particle is described by a minimal cost resolution which consists on a single
small kernel (bell-shaped function) concomitant to the particle. The main role
of the particle kernel is to interpolate fluid properties and spread particle
forces. Here, we extend the kernel functionality to allow for an arbitrary
particle compressibility. The particle-fluid force is obtained from an imposed
no-slip constraint which enforces similar particle and kernel fluid velocities.
This coupling is instantaneous and permits to capture the fast, non-linear
effects underlying the radiation forces on particles. Acoustic forces arise
either because an excess in particle compressibility (monopolar term) or in
mass (dipolar contribution) over the fluid values. Comparison with theoretical
expressions show that the present generalization of the IC method correctly
reproduces both contributions. Due to its low computational cost, the present

prototype geometries were used in this investigation in conjunction with two
fluid models: Ellis and Herschel-Bulkley. The method was validated by
convergence behavior sensibility tests, convergence to analytical solutions for

was also conducted on a sample of diverging-converging geometries. The method
can in principle be extended to the flow of viscoelastic and
thixotropic/rheopectic fluid categories. The method can also be extended to
geometries varying in size and shape in the flow direction, other than the
perfect cylindrically-symmetric converging-diverging ones, as long as
characteristic flow relations correlating the flow rate to the pressure drop on
the discretized elements of the lubrication approximation can be found. These
relations can be analytical, empirical and even numerical and hence the method

Density functional theory of electrowetting,http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.6886v2,"['Markus Bier', 'Ingrid Ibagon']","  The phenomenon of electrowetting, i.e., the dependence of the macroscopic
contact angle of a fluid on the electrostatic potential of the substrate, is
analyzed in terms of the density functional theory of wetting. It is shown that
electrowetting is not an electrocapillarity effect, i.e., it cannot be
consistently understood in terms of the variation of the substrate-fluid
interfacial tension with the electrostatic substrate potential, but it is
related to the depth of the effective interface potential. The key feature,
which has been overlooked so far and which occurs naturally in the density
functional approach is the structural change of a fluid if it is brought into
contact with another fluid. These structural changes occur in the present
context as the formation of finite films of one fluid phase in between the
substrate and the bulk of the other fluid phase. The non-vanishing Donnan
potentials (Galvani potential differences) across such film-bulk fluid
interfaces, which generically occur due to an unequal partitioning of ions as a
result of differences of solubility contrasts, lead to correction terms in the
electrowetting equation, which become relevant for sufficiently small substrate
potentials. Whereas the present density functional approach confirms the
commonly used electrocapillarity-based electrowetting equation as a good
approximation for the cases of metallic electrodes or electrodes coated with a
hydrophobic dielectric in contact with an electrolyte solution and an ion-free
oil, a significantly reduced tendency for electrowetting is predicted for
electrodes coated with a dielectric which is hydrophilic or which is in contact
with two immiscible electrolyte solutions.

is surrounded by an envelope of incompressible uniform density fluid. The
corresponding linear problem was studied in previous papers which this work
extends into the nonlinear regime, at moderate Ekman numbers (the ratio of
viscous to Coriolis accelerations). By performing high-resolution numerical
simulations, using a combination of pseudo-spectral and spectral element
methods, we investigate the effects of nonlinearities, which lead to
time-dependence of the flow and the corresponding dissipation rate. Angular
momentum is deposited non-uniformly, leading to the generation of significant
differential rotation in the initially uniformly rotating fluid, i.e. the body
does not evolve towards synchronism as a simple solid body rotator. This
differential rotation modifies the properties of tidally excited inertial
waves, changes the dissipative properties of the flow, and eventually becomes
unstable to a secondary shear instability provided that the Ekman number is
sufficiently small. Our main result is that the inclusion of nonlinearities
eventually modifies the flow and the resulting dissipation from what linear
calculations would predict, which has important implications for tidal
dissipation in fluid bodies. We finally discuss some limitations of our

Metriplectic Algebra for Dissipative Fluids in Lagrangian Formulation,http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.6542v1,['Massimo F. D. Materassi'],"  It is known that the dynamics of dissipative fluids in Eulerian variables can
be derived from an algebra of Leibniz brackets of observables, the metriplectic
algebra, that extends the Poisson algebra of the zero viscosity limit via a
symmetric, semidefinite component. This metric bracket generates dissipative
forces.
  The metriplectic algebra includes the conserved total Hamiltonian $H$,
generating the non-dissipative part of dynamics, and the entropy $S$ of those
microscopic degrees of freedom draining energy irreversibly, that generates
dissipation. This $S$ is a Casimir of the Poisson algebra to which the
metriplectic algebra reduces in the frictionless limit.
  In the present paper, the metriplectic framework for viscous fluids is
re-written in the Lagrangian Formulation, where the system is described through
material variables: this is a way to describe the continuum much closer to the
discrete system dynamics than the Eulerian fields. Accordingly, the full
metriplectic algebra is constructed in material variables, and this will render
it possible to apply it in all those cases in which the Lagrangian Formulation
is preferred.
  The role of the entropy $S$ of a metriplectic system is as paramount as that
of the Hamiltonian $H$, but this fact may be underestimated in the Eulerian
formulation because $S$ is not the only Casimir of the symplectic non-canonical
part of the algebra. Instead, when the dynamics of the non-ideal fluid is
written through the parcel variables of the Lagrangian formulation, the fact
that entropy is symplectically invariant appears to be more clearly related to
its dependence on the microscopic degrees of freedom of the fluid, that do not
participate at all to the symplectic canonical part of the algebra (which,
indeed, involves and evolves only the macroscopic degrees of freedom of the
fluid parcel).

number beyond which computations fail to converge is found to increase with
increasing dimensionless solid elasticity parameter {\Gamma}, following the
trend Owens > FENE- P > Oldroyd-B. The highly shear thinning nature of Owens
model leads to the elastic solid always collapsing into the channel, for the
wide range of values of {\Gamma} considered here. In the case of the FENE-P and
Oldroyd-B models, however, the fluid-solid interface can be either within the
channel, or bulge outwards, depending on the value of {\Gamma}. This behaviour
differs considerably from predictions of earlier models that treat the
deformable solid as a zero-thickness membrane, in which case the membrane
always lies within the channel. The capacity of the solid wall to support both
pressure and shear stress, in contrast to the zero-thickness membrane that only
responds to pressure, is responsible for the observed difference. Compar- ison
of the stress and velocity fields in the channel for the three viscoelastic

believed to be the result of fluid convection in combination with particle size

develop a granular front. Within a large rotating drum, a stationary
recirculating avalanche is generated. The flowing material is a mixture of a
visco-plastic fluid obtained from a kaolin-water dispersion, with spherical
ceramic particles denser than the fluid. The goal is to mimic the composition
of many common granular-fluid materials, like fresh concrete or debris flow. In
these materials, granular and fluid phases have the natural tendency to
segregate due to particle settling. However, through the shearing caused by the
rotation of the drum, a reorganization of the phases is induced, leading to the
formation of a granular front. By tuning the material properties and the drum
velocity, it is possible to control this phenomenon. The setting is reproduced

"Sedimentation of finite-size spheres in quiescent and turbulent
  environments",http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06148v2,"['Walter Fornari', 'Francesco Picano', 'Luca Brandt']","  Sedimentation of a dispersed solid phase is widely encountered in
applications and environmental flows, yet little is known about the behavior of
finite-size particles in homogeneous isotropic turbulence. To fill this gap, we
perform Direct Numerical Simulations of sedimentation in quiescent and
turbulent environments using an Immersed Boundary Method to account for the
dispersed rigid spherical particles. The solid volume fractions considered are
0.5-1%, while the solid to fluid density ratio 1.02. The particle radius is
chosen to be approximately 6 Komlogorov lengthscales. The results show that the
mean settling velocity is lower in an already turbulent flow than in a
quiescent fluid. The reduction with respect to a single particle in quiescent
fluid is about 12\% and 14\% for the two volume fractions investigated. The
probability density function of the particle velocity is almost Gaussian in a
turbulent flow, whereas it displays large positive tails in quiescent fluid.
These tails are associated to the intermittent fast sedimentation of particle
pairs in drafting-kissing-tumbling motions. The particle lateral dispersion is
higher in a turbulent flow, whereas the vertical one is, surprisingly, of
comparable magnitude as a consequence of the highly intermittent behavior
observed in the quiescent fluid. Using the concept of mean relative velocity we
estimate the mean drag coefficient from empirical formulas and show that non
stationary effects, related to vortex shedding, explain the increased reduction
in mean settling velocity in a turbulent environment.

"Optimal reservoir conditions for fluid extraction through permeable
  walls in the viscous limit",http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01469v1,"['Gregory Herschlag', 'Jian-Guo Liu', 'Anita T. Layton']","  In biological transport mechanisms such as insect respiration and renal
filtration, fluid travels along a leaky channel allowing exchange with systems
exterior the the channel. The channels in these systems may undergo peristaltic
pumping which is thought to enhance the material exchange. To date, little
analytic work has been done to study the effect of pumping on material
extraction across the channel walls. In this paper, we examine a fluid
extraction model in which fluid flowing through a leaky channel is exchanged
with fluid in a reservoir. The channel walls are allowed to contract and expand
uniformly, simulating a pumping mechanism. In order to efficiently determine
solutions of the model, we derive a formal power series solution for the Stokes
equations in a finite channel with uniformly contracting/expanding permeable
walls. This flow has been well studied in the case of weakly permeable channel
walls in which the normal velocity at the channel walls is proportional to the
wall velocity. In contrast we do not assume weakly driven flow, but flow driven
by hydrostatic pressure, and we use Dacry's law to close our system for normal
wall velocity. We use our flow solution to examine flux across the
channel-reservoir barrier and demonstrate that pumping can either enhance or
impede fluid extraction across channel walls. We find that associated with each
set of physical flow and pumping parameters, there are optimal reservoir
conditions that maximizes the amount of material flowing from the channel into
the reservoir.

gradients, we relate the stresses of the fluid with the viscosity coefficients,
the shear tensor and the expansion factor. Exploiting these relations, we can
write the stresses in terms of the extrinsic curvature of the normal surface to
the 4-velocity vector of the fluid, and we can also establish a connection
between the perfect fluid and the symmetries of the spacetime. On the other
hand, we calculate the energy conditions for a dissipative fluid through
contractions of the energy-momentum tensor with the 4-velocity vector of an
arbitrary observer. This method is interesting because it allows us to compute
the conditions in a reasonable easy way and without considering any

Epi-two-dimensional flow and generalized enstrophy,http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02339v1,"['Zensho Yoshida', 'Philip J. Morrison']","  The conservation of the enstrophy ($L^2$ norm of the vorticity $\omega$)
plays an essential role in the physics and mathematics of two-dimensional (2D)
Euler fluids. Generalizing to compressible ideal (inviscid and barotropic)
fluids, the generalized enstrophy $\int_{\Sigma(t)} f(\omega/\rho)\rho\, d^2
x$, ($f$ an arbitrary smooth function, $\rho$ the density, and $\Sigma(t)$ an
arbitrary 2D domain co-moving with the fluid) is a constant of motion, and
plays the same role. On the other hand, for the three-dimensional (3D) ideal
fluid, the helicity $\int_{M} {V}\cdot\omega\,d^3x$, ($V$ the flow velocity,
$\omega=\nabla\times V$, and ${M}$ the three-dimensional domain containing the
fluid) is conserved. Evidently, the helicity degenerates in a 2D system, and
the (generalized) enstrophy emerges as a compensating constant. This transition
of the constants of motion is a reflection of an essential difference between
2D and 3D systems, because the conservation of the (generalized) enstrophy
imposes stronger constraints, than the helicity, on the flow. In this paper, we
make a deeper inquiry into the helicity-enstrophy interplay: the ideal fluid
mechanics is cast into a Hamiltonian form in the phase space of Clebsch
parameters, generalizing 2D to a wider category of epi-2D flows (2D embedded in
3D has zero helicity, while the converse is not true -- our epi-2D category
encompasses a wider class of zero-helicity flows); how helicity degenerates and
is substituted by a new constant is delineated; and how a further generalized
enstrophy is introduced as a constant of motion applying to epi-2D flow is
described.

fluids with different rheological properties, (i) viscous fluids with a
zero-shear viscosity $\eta_0$ in the range $(1-1000) \, \mathrm{mPa.s}$ and
(ii) viscoelastic Maxwell fluids whose elastic modulus, $G_0$, characteristic
relaxation time, $\tau$, and zero-shear viscosity, $\eta_0=G_0 \tau$, can be
tuned over several orders of magnitude. The sheets are produced by impacting a
drop of fluid on a small cylindrical solid target. For viscoelastic fluids, we
show that, when $\tau$ is shorter than the typical lifetime of the sheet ($\sim
10$ ms), the dynamics of the sheet is similar to that of Newtonian viscous
liquids with equal zero-shear viscosity. In that case, for little viscous
samples ($\eta_0 <\sim 30$ mPa.s), the maximal expansion of the sheet,
$d_{\rm{max}}$, is independent of $\eta_0$, whereas for more viscous samples,
$d_{\rm{max}}$ decreases as $\eta_0$ increases. We provide a simple model to
account for the dependence of the maximal expansion of the sheet with the
viscosity that is based on an energy balance between inertia, surface tension
and viscous shear dissipation on the solid target, and which accounts well for
our experimental data. By contrast, when $\tau$ is longer than the typical
lifetime of the sheet, the behavior drastically differs. The sheet expansion is
strongly enhanced as compared to that of viscous samples with comparable
zero-shear viscosity, but is heterogeneous with the occurrence of cracks,
revealing the elastic nature of the viscoelastic fluid.

differential equations for the metric coefficients, g 11 and g 22. We have
explored a class of solutions assuming that M is a linear function of the

Reduced particle settling speed in turbulence,http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08549v2,"['Walter Fornari', 'Francesco Picano', 'Gaetano Sardina', 'Luca Brandt']","  We study the settling of finite-size rigid spheres in sustained homogeneous
isotropic turbulence (HIT) by direct numerical simulations using an immersed
boundary method to account for the dispersed solid phase. We study semi-dilute
suspensions at different Galileo numbers, Ga. The Galileo number is the ratio
between buoyancy and viscous forces, and is here varied via the solid-to-fluid
density ratio. The focus is on particles that are slightly heavier than the
fluid. We find that in HIT, the mean settling speed is less than that in
quiescent fluid; in particular, it reduces by 6%-60% with respect to the
terminal velocity of an isolated sphere in quiescent fluid as the ratio between
the latter and the turbulent velocity fluctuations is decreased. Analysing the
fluid-particle relative motion, we find that the mean settling speed is
progressively reduced while reducing the density ratio due to the increase of
the vertical drag induced by the particle cross-flow velocity. Unsteady effects
contribute to the mean overall drag by about 6%-10%. The probability density
functions of particle velocities and accelerations reveal that these are
closely related to the features of the turbulent flow. The particle mean-square
displacement in the settling direction is found to be similar for all Ga if
time is scaled by (2a)/u' (where 2a is the particle diameter and u' is the
turbulence velocity root mean square).

A mechanical model for phase-separation in debris flow,http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03649v1,"['Shiva P. Pudasaini', 'Jan-Thomas Fischer']","  Understanding the physics of phase-separation between solid and fluid phases
as a mixture mass moves down slope is a long-standing challenge. Here, we
propose an extension of the two phase mass flow model (Pudasaini, 2012) by
including a new mechanism, called separation-flux, that leads to strong
phase-separation in avalanche and debris flows while balancing the enhanced
solid flux with the reduced fluid flux. The separation flux mechanism is
capable of describing the dynamically evolving phase-separation and levee
formation in a multi-phase, geometrically three-dimensional debris flow. These
are often observed phenomena in natural debris flows and industrial processes
that involve the transportation of particulate solid-fluid mixture material.
The novel separation-flux model includes several dominant physical and
mechanical aspects such as pressure gradients, volume fractions of solid and
fluid phases and their gradients, shear-rates, flow depth, material friction,
viscosity, material densities, topographic constraints, grain size, etc. Due to
the inherent separation mechanism, as the mass moves down slope, more and more
solid particles are transported to the front and the sides, resulting in
solid-rich and mechanically strong frontal surge head, and lateral levees
followed by a weaker tail largely consisting of viscous fluid. The primary
frontal solid-rich surge head followed by secondary fluid-rich surges is the
consequence of phase-separation. Such typical and dominant phase-separation
phenomena are revealed for two-phase debris flow simulations. Finally, changes
in flow composition, that are explicitly considered by the new modelling
approach, result in significant changes of impact pressure estimates. These are
highly important in hazard assessment and mitigation planning and highlight the
application potential of the new approach.

Continuum Kinetic and Multi-Fluid Simulations of Classical Sheaths,http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06529v2,"['Petr Cagas', 'Ammar Hakim', 'James Juno', 'Bhuvana Srinivasan']","  The kinetic study of plasma sheaths is critical, among other things, to
understand the deposition of heat on walls, the effect of sputtering, and
contamination of the plasma with detrimental impurities. The plasma sheath also
provides a boundary condition and can often have a significant global impact on
the bulk plasma. In this paper, kinetic studies of classical sheaths are
performed with the continuum code, Gkeyll, that directly solves the
Vlasov-Poisson/Maxwell equations. The code uses a novel version of the
finite-element discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme that conserves energy in the
continuous-time limit. The electrostatic field is computed using the Poisson
equation. Ionization and scattering collisions are included, however, surface
effects are neglected. The aim of this work is to introduce the
continuum-kinetic method and compare its results to those obtained from an
already established finite-volume multi-fluid model also implemented in Gkeyll.
Novel boundary conditions on the fluids allow the sheath to form without
specifying wall fluxes, so the fluids and fields adjust self-consistently at
the wall. The work presented here demonstrates that the kinetic and fluid
results are in agreement for the momentum flux, showing that in certain
regimes, a multi-fluid model can be a useful approximation for simulating the
plasma boundary. There are differences in the electrostatic potential between
the fluid and kinetic results. Further, the direct solutions of the
distribution function presented here highlight the non-Maxwellian distribution
of electrons in the sheath, emphasizing the need for a kinetic model.

Concurrent and counter-current inclined systems are investigated, including the
mapping of multiple solution boundaries. Aspects relevant to practical
applications are discussed, such as the insitu hold-up, or lubrication effects
achieved by adding a less viscous phase. A characteristic of this family of
systems is that, even if the liquid has a complex rheology (Carreau fluid), the
two-phase stratified flow can behave like the liquid is Newtonian for a wide
range of operational conditions. The capability of the two-fluid model to yield
satisfactory predictions in the presence of shear-thinning liquids is tested,
and an algorithm is proposed to a priori predict if the Newtonian (zero shear
rate viscosity) behaviour arises for a given operational conditions in order to
avoid large errors in the predictions of flow characteristics when the

Energy harvesting efficiency of piezoelectric flags in axial flows,http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.2171v1,"['Sebastien Michelin', 'Olivier Doare']","  Self-sustained oscillations resulting from fluid-solid instabilities, such as
the flutter of a flexible flag in axial flow, can be used to harvest energy if
one is able to convert the solid energy into electricity. Here, this is
achieved using piezoelectric patches attached to the surface of the flag that
convert the solid deformation into an electric current powering purely
resistive output circuits. Nonlinear numerical simulations in the slender-body
limit, based on an explicit description of the coupling between the fluid-solid
and electric systems, are used to determine the harvesting efficiency of the
system, namely the fraction of the flow kinetic energy flux effectively used to
power the output circuit, and its evolution with the system's parameters. The
role of the tuning between the characteristic frequencies of the fluid-solid
and electric systems is emphasized, as well as the critical impact of the
piezoelectric coupling intensity. High fluid loading, classically associated
with destabilization by damping, leads to greater energy harvesting, but with a
weaker robustness to flow velocity fluctuations due to the sensitivity of the
flapping mode selection. This suggests that a control of this mode selection by
a careful design of the output circuit could provide some opportunities of
improvement for the efficiency and robustness of the energy harvesting process.

particles in triply-periodic domains has been performed under dilute
conditions. For a single solid-to-fluid density ratio of 1.5 we have considered
two values of the Galileo number corresponding to steady vertical motion
(Ga=121) and to steady oblique motion (Ga=178) in the case of one isolated
sphere. For the multi-particle system we observe strong particle clustering
only in the latter case. The geometry and time scales related to clustering are
determined from Voronoi tesselation and particle-conditioned averaging. As a
consequence of clustering, the average particle settling velocity is increased
by 12% as compared to the value of an isolated sphere; such a collective effect
is not observed in the non-clustering case. By defining a local (instantaneous)
fluid velocity average in the vicinity of the finite-size particles it is shown
that the observed enhancement of the settling velocity is due to the fact that
the downward fluid motion (with respect to the global average) which is induced
in the cluster regions is preferentially sampled by the particles. It is
further observed that the variance of the particle velocity is strongly
enhanced in the clustering case. With the aid of a decomposition of the
particle velocity it is shown that this increase is due to enhanced fluid
velocity fluctuations (due to clustering) in the vicinity of the particles.
Finally, we discuss a possible explanation for the observation of a critical
Galileo number marking the onset of clustering under dilute conditions.

Dynamics of swimming bacteria at complex interfaces,http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4412v2,"['Diego Lopez', 'Eric Lauga']","  Flagellated bacteria exploiting helical propulsion are known to swim along
circular trajectories near surfaces. Fluid dynamics predicts this circular
motion to be clockwise (CW) above a rigid surface (when viewed from inside the
fluid) and counter-clockwise (CCW) below a free surface. Recent experimental
investigations showed that complex physicochemical processes at the nearby
surface could lead to a change in the direction of rotation, both at solid
surfaces absorbing slip-inducing polymers and interfaces covered with
surfactants. Motivated by these results, we use a far-field hydrodynamic model
to predict the kinematics of swimming near three types of interfaces: clean
fluid-fluid interface, slipping rigid wall, and a fluid interface covered by
incompressible surfactants. Representing the helical swimmer by a superposition
of hydrodynamic singularities, we first show that in all cases the surfaces
reorient the swimmer parallel to the surface and attract it, both of which are
a consequence of the Stokes dipole component of the swimmer flow field. We then
show that circular motion is induced by a higher-order singularity, namely a
rotlet dipole, and that its rotation direction (CW vs. CCW) is strongly
affected by the boundary conditions at the interface and the bacteria shape.
Our results suggest thus that the hydrodynamics of complex interfaces provide a
mechanism to selectively stir bacteria.

Small-amplitude swimmers can self-propel faster in viscoelastic fluids,http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00021v1,"['Emily E. Riley', 'Eric Lauga']","  Many small organisms self-propel in viscous fluids using travelling wave-like
deformation of their bodies or appendages. Examples include small nematodes
moving through soil using whole-body undulations or spermatozoa swimming
through mucus using flagellar waves. When self-propulsion occurs in a
non-Newtonian fluid, one fundamental question is whether locomotion will occur
faster or slower than in a Newtonian environment. Here we consider the general
problem of swimming using small-amplitude periodic waves in a viscoelastic
fluid described by the classical Oldroyd-B constitutive relationship. Using
Taylor's swimming sheet model, we show that if all travelling waves move in the
same direction, the locomotion speed of the organism is systematically
decreased. However, if we allow waves to travel in two opposite directions, we
show that this can lead to enhancement of the swimming speed, which is
physically interpreted as due to asymmetric viscoelastic damping of waves with
different frequencies. A change of the swimming direction is also possible. By
analysing in detail the cases of swimming using two or three travelling waves,
we demonstrate that swimming can be enhanced in a viscoelastic fluid for all
Deborah numbers below a critical value or, for three waves or more, only for a
finite, non-zero range of Deborah numbers, in which case a finite amount of
elasticity in the fluid is required to increase the swimming speed.

mechanical phenomena ranging from fluid mixing and particle transport to stress
development in complex fluids and the formation of Lagrangian coherent
structures (LCSs). To understand and model these processes it is necessary to
quantify Lagrangian deformation in terms of Eulerian flow properties, currently
an open problem. To elucidate this link we develop a Protean (streamline)
coordinate transform for steady three-dimensional (3D) flows which renders both
the velocity gradient and deformation gradient upper triangular. This frame not
only simplifies computation of fluid deformation metrics such as finite-time
Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs) and elucidates the deformation structure of the
flow, but moreover explicitly recovers kinematic and topological constraints
upon deformation such as those related to helicity density and the
Poincar\'{e}-Bendixson theorem. We apply this transform to several classes of
steady 3D flow, including helical and non-helical, compressible and
incompressible flows, and find random flows exhibit remarkably simple
(Gaussian) deformation structure, and so are fully characterised in terms of a
small number of parameters. As such this technique provides the basis for the
development of stochastic models of fluid deformation in random flows which
adhere to the kinematic constraints inherent to various flow classes.

that, as in bulk, the confined fluid has structural, diffusion and density
anomalies, that order in the water-like hierarchy, and a liquid-liquid critical

collisions between heavy nuclei produce a state of matter with surprising fluid
properties. Non-central collisions have angular momentum on the order of
1000$\hbar$, and the resulting fluid may have a strong vortical structure that
must be understood to properly describe the fluid. It is also of particular
interest because the restoration of fundamental symmetries of quantum
chromodynamics is expected to produce novel physical effects in the presence of
strong vorticity. However, no experimental indications of fluid vorticity in
heavy ion collisions have so far been found. Here we present the first
measurement of an alignment between the angular momentum of a non-central
collision and the spin of emitted particles, revealing that the fluid produced
in heavy ion collisions is by far the most vortical system ever observed. We
find that $\Lambda$ and $\overline{\Lambda}$ hyperons show a positive
polarization of the order of a few percent, consistent with some hydrodynamic
predictions. A previous measurement that reported a null result at higher
collision energies is seen to be consistent with the trend of our new
observations, though with larger statistical uncertainties. These data provide
the first experimental access to the vortical structure of the ""perfect fluid""
created in a heavy ion collision. They should prove valuable in the development
of hydrodynamic models that quantitatively connect observations to the theory
of the Strong Force. Our results extend the recent discovery of hydrodynamic
spin alignment to the subatomic realm.

to the field equations, we have considered a scale factor, known as hybrid

simulates a cosmic transition from early deceleration to late time
acceleration. It is observed that the string fluid dominates the universe at
early deceleration phase but does not affect nature of cosmic dynamics
substantially at late phase where as, the DE fluid dominates the universe in
present time, which is in accordance with the observations results. Hence, we
analysed here the role of two fluids in the transitional phases of universe

Two-fluid model for locomotion under self-confinement,http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01377v1,"['Shang Yik Reigh', 'Eric Lauga']","  The bacterium Helicobacter pylori causes ulcers in the stomach of humans by
invading mucus layers protecting epithelial cells. It does so by chemically
changing the rheological properties of the mucus from a high-viscosity gel to a
low-viscosity solution in which it may self-propel. We develop a two-fluid
model for this process of swimming under self-generated confinement. We solve
exactly for the flow and the locomotion speed of a spherical swimmer located in
a spherically symmetric system of two Newtonian fluids whose boundary moves
with the swimmer. We also treat separately the special case of an immobile
outer fluid. In all cases, we characterise the flow fields, their spatial
decay, and the impact of both the viscosity ratio and the degree of confinement
on the locomotion speed of the model swimmer. The spatial decay of the flow
retains the same power-law decay as for locomotion in a single fluid but with a
decreased magnitude. Independently of the assumption chosen to characterise the
impact of confinement on the actuation applied by the swimmer, its locomotion
speed always decreases with an increase in the degree of confinement. Our
modelling results suggest that a low-viscosity region of at least six times the
effective swimmer size is required to lead to swimming with speeds similar to
locomotion in an infinite fluid, corresponding to a region of size above
$\approx 25~\mu$m for Helicobacter pylori.

modified Euler equation [T. Tao, Ann. PDE \textbf{2}, 9 (2016)] is also
accordingly analyzed and remarked from the angle of view of two-fluid model,
with emphasis on the local structures. And, the local constraints of high-order

find practical application in non-ideal flows. Some formal examples are offered
to outline the calculations, and particularly interestingly the

presents that a locally invariant $\Theta = 2\theta \zeta$, with $\theta$ and
$\zeta$ being respectively the scalar value of the `vertical velocity' (or the
passive scalar) and the `vertical vorticity', may be used as if it were the
spatial density of the globally invariant helicity, providing a Lagrangian
prescription to control the latter in some situations of studying its physical
effects in rapidly rotating flows (ubiquitous in atmosphere of astrophysical
objects) with marked 2D3C vortical modes or in purely 2D passive scalars.

simulate the fluid-structure interaction of a nonlinear multibody system in an
incompressible turbulent flow. The proposed formulation relies on a
three-dimensional (3D) incompressible turbulent flow solver, a nonlinear
monolithic elastic structural solver for constrained flexible multibody system
and the nonlinear iterative force correction scheme for coupling of the
turbulent fluid-flexible multibody system with nonmatching interface meshes.
While the fluid equations are discretized using a stabilized Petrov-Galerkin
formulation in space and the generalized-$\alpha$ updates in time, the
multibody system utilizes a discontinuous space-time Galerkin finite element
method. We address two key challenges in the present formulation. Firstly, the
coupling of the incompressible turbulent flow with a system of nonlinear
elastic bodies described in a co-rotated frame. Secondly, the projection of the
tractions and displacements across the nonmatching 3D fluid surface elements
and the one-dimensional line elements for the flexible multibody system in a
conservative manner. Through the nonlinear iterative correction and the
conservative projection, the developed fluid-flexible multibody interaction
solver is stable for problems involving strong inertial effects between the
fluid-flexible multibody system and the coupled interactions among each
multibody component. The accuracy of the proposed coupled finite element
framework is validated against the available experimental data for a long
flexible cylinder undergoing vortex-induced vibration in a uniform current flow

demonstrated by simulating the flow-induced vibration of a realistic offshore

Centrifugally forced Rayleigh-Taylor Instability,http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01809v1,"['M. M. Scase', 'R. J. A. Hill']","  The effect of rotation on the classical gravity-driven Rayleigh-Taylor
instability has been shown to influence the scale of the perturbations that
develop at the unstable interface and consequently alter the speed of
propagation of the front. The present authors argued that this is as a result
of a competition between the destabilizing effect of gravity and the
stabilizing effect of the rotation. In the present paper we consider the
extreme limit of high rotation rates in which rotational forces dominate and
gravitational forces may be ignored. The two liquid layers initially form
concentric cylinders, centred on the axis of rotation. The configuration may be
thought of as a fluid-fluid centrifuge. There are two types of perturbation to
the interface that may be considered, an azimuthal perturbation around the
circumference of the interface and a varicose perturbation in the axial
direction along the length of the interface. It is the first of these types of
perturbation that we consider here, and so the flow may be considered
essentially two-dimensional, taking place in a circular domain.
  We carry out a linear stability analysis on a perturbation to the hydrostatic
background state and derive a fourth order Orr-Sommerfeld-like equation that
governs the system. We consider the dynamics of systems of stable and unstable
configurations, inviscid and viscous fluids, immiscible fluid layers with
surface tension, and miscible fluid layers that may have some initial diffusion
of density. Theoretical predictions are compared with numerical experiments and
the agreement is shown to be good. We do not restrict our analysis to equal
volume fluid layers and so our results also have applications in coating and
lubrication problems in rapidly rotating systems and machinery.

  viscosity silicone oil: effects of shear-thinning and viscoelasticity",http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06218v1,"['Alexandros Syrakos', 'Yannis Dimakopoulos', 'John Tsamopoulos']","  The flow inside a fluid damper where a piston reciprocates sinusoidally
inside an outer casing containing high-viscosity silicone oil is simulated
using a Finite Volume method, at various excitation frequencies. The oil is
modelled by the Carreau-Yasuda (CY) and Phan-Thien \& Tanner (PTT) constitutive
equations. Both models account for shear-thinning but only the PTT model
accounts for elasticity. The CY and other generalised Newtonian models have
been previously used in theoretical studies of fluid dampers, but the present
study is the first to perform full two-dimensional (axisymmetric) simulations
employing a viscoelastic constitutive equation. It is found that the CY and PTT
predictions are similar when the excitation frequency is low, but at medium and
higher frequencies the CY model fails to describe important phenomena that are
predicted by the PTT model and observed in experimental studies found in the
literature, such as the hysteresis of the force-displacement and force-velocity
loops. Elastic effects are quantified by applying a decomposition of the damper
force into elastic and viscous components, inspired from LAOS (Large Amplitude
Oscillatory Shear) theory. The CY model also overestimates the damper force
relative to the PTT, because it underpredicts the flow development length
inside the piston-cylinder gap. It is thus concluded that (a) fluid elasticity
must be accounted for and (b) theoretical approaches that rely on the
assumption of one-dimensional flow in the piston-cylinder gap are of limited
accuracy, even if they account for fluid viscoelasticity. The consequences of
using lower-viscosity silicone oil are also briefly examined.

"Fluid-structure interaction simulations of venous valves: a monolithic
  ALE method for large structural displacements",http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01321v1,"['Sara Calandrini', 'Eugenio Aulisa']","  Venous valves are bicuspidal valves that ensure that blood in veins only
flows back to the heart. To prevent retrograde blood flow, the two intraluminal
leaflets meet in the center of the vein and occlude the vessel. In
fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations of venous valves, the large
structural displacements may lead to mesh deteriorations and entanglements,
causing instabilities of the solver and, consequently, the numerical solution
to diverge. In this paper, we propose an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE)
scheme for FSI simulations designed to solve these instabilities. A monolithic
formulation for the FSI problem is considered and, due to the complexity of the
operators, the exact Jacobian matrix is evaluated using automatic
differentiation. The method relies on the introduction of a staggered in time
velocity %in the discretization scheme to improve stability, and on fictitious
springs to model the contact force of the valve leaflets. Since the large
structural displacements may compromise the quality of the fluid mesh as well,
a smoother fluid displacement, obtained with the introduction of a scaling
factor that measures the distance of a fluid element from the valve leaflet
tip, guarantees that there are no mesh entanglements in the fluid domain. To
further improve stability, a Streamline Upwind Petrov Galerkin (SUPG) method is
employed. The proposed ALE scheme is applied to a 2D model of a venous valve.
The presented simulations show that the proposed method deals well with the
large structural displacements of the problem, allowing a reconstruction of the
valve behavior in both the opening and closing phase.

  Perspective",http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06075v2,['Christian Y. Cardall'],"  A kinetic theory of classical particles serves as a unified basis for
developing a geometric $3+1$ spacetime perspective on fluid dynamics capable of
embracing both Minkowski and Galilei/Newton spacetimes. Parallel treatment of
these cases on as common a footing as possible reveals that the particle
four-momentum is better regarded as comprising momentum and \textit{inertia}
rather than momentum and energy; and consequently, that the object now known as
the stress-energy or energy-momentum tensor is more properly understood as a
stress-\textit{inertia} or \textit{inertia}-momentum tensor. In dealing with
both fiducial and comoving frames as fluid dynamics requires, tensor
decompositions in terms of the four-velocities of observers associated with
these frames render use of coordinate-free geometric notation not only fully
viable, but conceptually simplifying. A particle number four-vector,
three-momentum $(1,1)$ tensor, and kinetic energy four-vector characterize a
simple fluid and satisfy balance equations involving spacetime divergences on
both Minkowski and Galilei/Newton spacetimes. Reduced to a fully $3+1$ form,
these equations yield the familiar conservative formulations of special
relativistic and non-relativistic hydrodynamics as partial differential
equations in inertial coordinates, and in geometric form will provide a useful
conceptual bridge to arbitrary-Lagrange-Euler and general relativistic

Intermittency enhancement in quantum turbulence,http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.11353v1,"['Emil Varga', 'Jian Gao', 'Wei Guo', 'Ladislav Skrbek']","  Intermittency is a hallmark of turbulence, which exists not only in turbulent
flows of classical viscous fluids but also in flows of quantum fluids such as
superfluid $^4$He. Despite the established similarity between turbulence in
classical fluids and quasi-classical turbulence in superfluid $^4$He, it has
been predicted that intermittency in superfluid $^4$He is temperature dependent
and enhanced for certain temperatures, which strikingly contrasts the nearly
flow-independent intermittency in classical turbulence. Experimental
verification of this theoretical prediction is challenging since it requires
well-controlled generation of quantum turbulence in $^4$He and flow measurement
tools with high spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we report an
experimental study of quantum turbulence generated by towing a grid through a

elastoviscoplastic fluid. The non-Newtonian flow is simulated by solving the
full incompressible Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the evolution equation
for the elastoviscoplastic stress tensor. The laminar simulations are carried
out for a wide range of Reynolds numbers, Bingham numbers and ratios of the
fluid and total viscosity, while the turbulent flow simulations are performed
at a fixed bulk Reynolds number equal to 2800 and weak elasticity. We show that
in the laminar flow regime the friction factor increases monotonically with the
Bingham number (yield stress) and decreases with the viscosity ratio, while in
the turbulent regime the the friction factor is almost independent of the
viscosity ratio and decreases with the Bingham number, until the flow
eventually returns to a fully laminar condition for large enough yield
stresses. Three main regimes are found in the turbulent case, depending on the
Bingham number: for low values, the friction Reynolds number and the turbulent
flow statistics only slightly differ from those of a Newtonian fluid; for
intermediate values of the Bingham number, the fluctuations increase and the
inertial equilibrium range is lost. Finally, for higher values the flow
completely laminarises. These different behaviors are associated with a
progressive increases of the volume where the fluid is not yielded, growing
from the centerline towards the walls as the Bingham number increases. The
unyielded region interacts with the near-wall structures, forming
preferentially above the high speed streaks. In particular, the near-wall
streaks and the associated quasi-streamwise vortices are strongly enhanced in
an highly elastoviscoplastic fluid and the flow becomes more correlated in the

include quantum effects such as electron Fermi pressure, Bohm pressure and spin

electron inertia must be taken into account, and can overlap with the quantum
effects. We write down the full set of two-fluid quantum MHD (QMHD) and analyze
the relative importance ofthese effects in the high density environments of
neutron star atmospheres and white dwarf interiors, finding that for a broad
range of parameters all these effects are operative. Of all spin interactions
we analyze only the spin-magnetic coupling, as it is linear in $\hbar$ and
consequently it is the strongest spin effect. We re-obtain the classical
two-fluid MHD dispersion relations corresponding to the magnetosonic and
Alfv\'en modes, modified by quantum effects. In the zero-spin case, for
propagation parallel to the magnetic field, we find that the frequency of the
fast mode is due to quantum effects modified by electron inertia, while the
frequency of the Alfv\'en-slow sector has no quantum corrections. For
perpendicular propagation, the fast-mode frequency is the same as for the
parallel propagation plus a correction due only to classical two-fluid effects.
When spin is considered, a whistler mode appears, which is due to two-fluid
spin-magnetic interaction. There are no modifications due to spin for parallel
propagation of magnetosonic and Alfv\'en waves, while for perpendicular prop
agation a dispersive term due to spin arises in the two-fluid expression for
the fast magnetosonic mode.

instability in Poiseuille flows with fluids close to their vapour-liquid

fluid, we consider supercritical carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) at pressure of 80 bar,
which is above its critical pressure of 73.9 bar. The Poiseuille flow is
characterized by the Reynolds number
($Re=\rho_{w}^{*}u_{r}^{*}h^{*}/\mu_{w}^{*}$), the product of Prandtl
($Pr=\mu_{w}^{*}C_{pw}^{*}/\kappa_{w}^{*}$) and Eckert number
($Ec=u_{r}^{*2}/C_{pw}^{*}T_{w}^{*}$), and the wall temperature that in
addition to pressure determines the thermodynamic reference condition. For low
Eckert numbers, the flow is essentially isothermal and no difference with the
well-known stability behaviour of incompressible flows is observed. However, if
the Eckert number increases, the viscous heating causes gradients of
thermodynamic and transport properties, and non-ideal gas effects become
significant. Three regimes of the laminar base flow can be considered,
subcritical (temperature in the channel is entirely below its pseudo-critical
value), transcritical, and supercritical temperature regime. If compared to the
linear stability of an ideal gas Poiseuille flow, we show that the base flow is
more unstable in the subcritical regime, inviscid unstable in the transcritical
regime, while significantly more stable in the supercritical regime. Following
the corresponding states principle, we expect that qualitatively similar
results will be obtained for other fluids at equivalent thermodynamic states.

recorded in several landforms. Broad and local scale geomorphological,
compositional and hydrological analyses point towards pervasive fluid
circulation through time. In this work we focus on mound fields located in the
interior of three casters larger than 40 km (Firsoff, Kotido and unnamed crater
20 km to the east) and showing strong morphological and textural resemblance to
terrestrial mud volcanoes and spring-related features. We infer that these
landforms likely testify the presence of a pressurized fluid reservoir at depth
and past fluid upwelling. We have performed morphometric analyses to
characterize the mound morphologies and consequently retrieve an accurate
automated mapping of the mounds within the craters for spatial distribution and
fractal clustering analysis. The outcome of the fractal clustering yields
information about the possible extent of the percolating fracture network at
depth below the craters. We have been able to constrain the depth of the
pressurized fluid reservoir between ~2.5 and 3.2 km of depth and hence, we
propose that mounds and mounds alignments are most likely associated to the
presence of fissure ridges and fluid outflow. Their process of formation is
genetically linked to the formation of large intra-crater bulges previously
interpreted as large scale spring deposits. The overburden removal caused by
the impact crater formation is the inferred triggering mechanism for fluid
pressurization and upwelling, that through time led to the formation of the
intra-crater bulges and, after compaction and sealing, to the widespread mound
fields in their surroundings.

"Viscoelastic effects on asymmetric two-dimensional vortex patterns in a
  strongly coupled dusty plasma",http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07205v1,"['Akanksha Gupta', 'Rupak Mukherjee', 'Rajaraman Ganesh']","  Strongly coupled dusty plasma medium is often described as a viscoelastic
fluid that retains its memory. In a flowing dusty plasma medium, vortices of
different sizes appear when the flow does not remain laminar. The vortices also
merge to transfer energy between different scales. In the present work, we
study the effect of viscoelasticity and compressibility over a localized vortex
structure and multiple rotational vortexes in a strongly coupled viscoelastic
dusty plasma medium. In case of single rotating vortex flow, a transverse wave
is generated from the localized vortex source and the evolution time of
generated waves is found to be reduced due to finite viscoelasticity and
compressibility of the medium. It is found that the viscoelasticity suppresses
the dispersion of vorticity. In the presence of multiple vortices, we find, the
vortex mergers get highly affected in the presence of memory effect of the
fluid, and thus the dynamics of the medium gets completely altered compared to
a non-viscoelastic fluid. For a compressible fluid, viscoelasticity damps out
the energy in the sonic waves generated in the medium. Thus a highly
viscoelastic and compressible fluid, in some cases, behaves similarly to an
incompressible viscoelastic fluid. The wave-front like rings propagate in
elliptical orbits keeping the footprint of the earlier position of the
point-vortex. The rings collide with each other even within the patch vortex
region forming regions of high vorticity at the point of intersection and pass
through each other.

Lennard Jones (LJ) fluids, deep into the supercritical phase, is studied over a
wide range of densities in the context of the Frenkel line (FL), which
separates rigid liquidlike and non-rigid gaslike regimes in the phase diagram
of the supercritical fluids. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations carried
out at the two ends of the FL (P = 5000 bars, T = 300 K, and T = 1500 K) reveal
intriguing features in supercritical fluids as a function of stiffness of the
partially confining atomistic walls. The liquidlike regime of a LJ fluid (P =
5000 bars, T = 300 K), mimicking argon, partially confined between walls
separated by 10 {\AA} along the z-axis, and otherwise unconstrained, reveals
amorphous and liquidlike structural signatures in the radial distribution
function parallel to the walls and enhanced self-diffusion as the wall
stiffness is decreased. In sharp contrast, in the gas-like regime (P = 5000
bars, T = 1500 K), soft walls lead to increasing structural order hindering
self-diffusion. Furthermore, the correlations between the structure and
self-diffusion are found to be well captured by excess entropy. The rich
behavior shown by supercritical fluids under partial confinement, even with
simple interatomic potentials, is found to be fairly independent of
hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity. The study identifies persisting
sub-diffusive features over intermediate time scales, emerging from the strong
interplay between density and confinement, to dictate the evolution and
stabilization of structures. It is anticipated that these results may help gain
a better understanding of the behavior of partially confined complex fluids

Decomposition of the forces on a body moving in an incompressible fluid,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02484v3,['W R Graham'],"  In analysing fluid forces on a moving body, a natural approach is to seek a
component due to viscosity and an `inviscid' remainder. It is also attractive
to decompose the velocity field into irrotational and rotational parts, and
apportion the force resultants accordingly. The `irrotational' resultants can
then be identified as classical `added mass', but the remaining, `rotational',
resultants appear not to be consistent with the physical interpretation of the
rotational velocity field (as that arising from the fluid vorticity with the
body stationary). The alternative presented here splits the inviscid resultants
into components that are unquestionably due to independent aspects of the
problem: `convective' and `accelerative'. The former are associated with the
pressure field that would arise in an inviscid flow with (instantaneously) the
same velocities as the real one, and with the body's velocity parameters ---
angular and translational --- unchanging. The latter correspond to the pressure
generated when the body accelerates from rest in quiescent fluid with its given
rates of change of angular and translational velocity. They are reminiscent of
the added-mass force resultants, but are simpler, and closer to the standard
rigid-body inertia formulae, than the developed expressions for added-mass
force and moment. Finally, the force resultants due to viscosity also include a
contribution from pressure. Its presence is necessary in order to satisfy the
equations governing the pressure field, and it has previously been recognised
in the context of `excess' stagnation-point pressure. However, its existence
does not yet seem to be widely appreciated.

Low-rank Linear Fluid-structure Interaction Discretizations,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11000v3,"['Roman Weinhandl', 'Peter Benner', 'Thomas Richter']","  Fluid-structure interaction models involve parameters that describe the solid

parameters to examine the behavior of a fluid-structure interaction model for
different solids and different fluids. A shipping company wants to know how the
material, a ship's hull is made of, interacts with fluids at different Reynolds
and Strouhal numbers before the building process takes place. Also, the
behavior of such models for solids with different properties is considered
before the prototype phase. A parameter-dependent linear fluid-structure
interaction discretization provides approximations for a bundle of different
parameters at one step. Such a discretization with respect to different
material parameters leads to a big block diagonal system matrix that is
equivalent to a matrix equation as discussed in [KressnerTobler 2011]. The
unknown is then a matrix which can be approximated using a low-rank approach
that represents the iterate by a tensor. This paper compares a low-rank GMRES
variant as first mentioned in [BallaniGrasedyck 2013] with a new solver, a
low-rank method that bases on the Chebyshev iteration. Numerical experiments

exponentially and power law decaying force functions between fluid particles

Effective drag of a rod in fluid-saturated granular beds,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10046v1,"['Benjamin Allen', 'Arshad Kudrolli']","  We measure the drag encountered by a vertically oriented rod moving across a
sedimented granular bed immersed in a fluid under steady-state conditions. At
low rod speeds, the presence of the fluid leads to a lower drag because of
buoyancy, whereas a significantly higher drag is observed with increasing
speeds. The drag as a function of depth is observed to decrease from being
quadratic at low speeds to appearing more linear at higher speeds. By scaling
the drag with the average weight of the grains acting on the rod, we obtain the
effective friction $\mu_e$ encountered over six orders of magnitude of speeds.
While a constant $\mu_e$ is found when the grain size, rod depth and fluid
viscosity are varied at low speeds, a systematic increase is observed as the
speed is increased. We analyze $\mu_e$ in terms of the inertial number $I$ and
viscous number $J$ to understand the relative importance of inertia and viscous
forces, respectively. For sufficiently large fluid viscosities, we find that
the effect of varying the speed, depth, and viscosity can be described by the
empirical function $\mu_e = \mu_o + k J^n$, where $\mu_o$ is the effective
friction measured in the quasi-static limit, and $k$ and $n$ are material
constants. The drag is then analyzed in terms of the effective viscosity
$\eta_e$ and found to decrease systematically as a function of $J$. We further
show that $\eta_e$ as a function of $J$ is directly proportional to the fluid
viscosity and the $\mu_e$ encountered by the rod.

become lighter than the fluid near the hot bottom plate and heavier than the
fluid near the cold top plate. Because of the opposite directions of the net
Archimedes' force on particles and fluid, particles deposited at the plate now
experience a relative force towards the bulk. The characteristic time for this
motion towards the bulk to happen, quantified as the time particles spend
inside the thermal boundary layers (BLs) at the plates, is shown to depend on
the thermal response time, $\tau_T$, and the thermal expansion coefficient of
particles relative to that of the fluid, $K = \alpha_p / \alpha_f$. In
particular, the residence time is constant for small thermal response times,
$\tau_T \lesssim 1$, and increasing with $\tau_T$ for larger thermal response
times, $\tau_T \gtrsim 1$. Also, the thermal BL residence time is increasing

high-resolution direct numerical simulations, here we show for the first time
that the shape of LSVs in rapidly-rotating mixed convective and
stably-stratified fluids, which approximates the two-layer,
turbulent-stratified dynamics of many geophysical and astrophysical fluids, is
universal and that their size can be predicted. Specifically, we show that LSVs
emerge in the convection zone from upscale energy transfers and decay as they
penetrate into the stratified layer by thermal wind balance, thus taking the
shape of a depth-invariant cylinder in the turbulent layer and of a penetrating
half dome in the stable one. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when LSVs
penetrate all the way through a stratified layer bounded by a solid boundary,
they saturate by boundary friction. We provide a prediction for the penetration
depth and maximum radius of LSVs as a function of the LSV vorticity, the stable
layer depth and the stratification. Our results suggest that while turbulent
vortices can penetrate far into the stratified layers of atmospheres and

stickiness parameter $\tau$. Such an equivalence cannot hold for the radial
distribution function since this function has a delta singularity at contact in
the SHS case, while it has a jump discontinuity at $r=\lambda$ in the SW case.
Therefore, the equivalence is explored with the cavity function $y(r)$.
Optimization of the agreement between $y_{\sw}$ and $y_{\shs}$ to first order
in density suggests the choice for $\tau$. We have performed Monte Carlo (MC)
simulations of the SW fluid for $\lambda=1.05$, 1.02, and 1.01 at several

Although, at given values of $\eta$ and $\tau$, some local discrepancies
between $y_{\sw}$ and $y_{\shs}$ exist (especially for $\lambda=1.05$), the SW
data converge smoothly toward the SHS values as $\lambda-1$ decreases. The

co-dimension in a background space-time, providing the effective theory
describing long-wavelength perturbations of black branes. When the co-dimension
is non-zero, the system acquires fluid-elastic properties and constitutes what
is called a fluid brane. Applying an effective action approach, the most
general form of the free energy quadratic in the extrinsic curvature and
extrinsic twist potential of stationary fluid brane configurations is
constructed to second order in a derivative expansion. This construction
generalizes the Helfrich-Canham bending energy for fluid membranes studied in
theoretical biology to the case in which the fluid is rotating. It is found
that stationary fluid brane configurations are characterized by a set of 3
elastic response coefficients, 3 hydrodynamic response coefficients and 1 spin
response coefficient for co-dimension greater than one. Moreover, the elastic
degrees of freedom present in the system are coupled to the hydrodynamic
degrees of freedom. For co-dimension-1 surfaces we find a 8 independent
parameter family of stationary fluid branes. It is further shown that elastic
and spin corrections to (non)-extremal brane effective actions can be accounted
for by a multipole expansion of the stress-energy tensor, therefore
establishing a relation between the different formalisms of Carter,

transport in an axisymmetric tube by cilia. However, an attempt has been made
to explain the role of cilia motion on the transport of fluid through the

viscous fluid has been considered to represent the rheological fluid. To
analyze pumping by means of a sequence of beat of cilia from row-to-row of
cilia in a given row of cells and from one row of cells to the next
(metachronal wave movement), we consider the conditions that the corresponding
Reynolds number is small enough for inertial effects to be negligible and the
wavelength to diameter ratio is large enough for the pressure to be considered
uniform over the cross-section. Analyses and computations of the detailed fluid
motion reveal that the time-averaged flow rate is dependent on $\epsilon$, a
non-dimensional measure involving the mean radius $a$ of the tube and the cilia
length. Thus, flow rate significantly varies with the cilia length. Moreover,
the flow rate has been reported near to the estimated value $6\times

estimated value was suggested by Lardner and Shack [1] in human, based on the
experimental observations for flow rates in efferent ducts of other animals,

pumping improves with the thickening behavior for small values of $\epsilon$ or

Dynamics and flow-coupling in two-layer turbulent thermal convection,http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04862v1,"['Yi-Chao Xie', 'Ke-Qing Xia']","  We present an experimental investigation of the dynamics and flow-coupling of
convective turbulent flows in a cylindrical Rayleigh-Benard convection cell
with two immiscible fluids, water and fluorinert FC-77 electronic liquid
(FC77). It is found that one large-scale circulation (LSC) roll exists in each
of the fluid layers, and that their circulation planes have two preferred
azimuthal orientations separated by $\sim\pi$. A surprising finding of the
study is that cessations/reversals of the LSC in FC77 of the two-layer system
occur much more frequently than they do in single-layer turbulent RBC, and that
a cessation is most likely to result in a flow reversal of the LSC, which is in
sharp contrast with the uniform distribution of the orientational angular
change of the LSC before and after cessations in single-layer turbulent RBC.
This implies that the dynamics governing cessations and reversals in the two
systems are very different. Two coupling modes, thermal coupling (flow
directions of the two LSCs are opposite to each other at the fluid-fluid
interface) and viscous coupling (flow directions of the two LSCs are the same
at the fluid-fluid interface), are identified with the former one as the
predominant mode. That most cessations (in the FC77 layer) end up as reversals
can be understood as a symmetry breaking imposed by the orientation of the LSC
in the water layer, which remained unchanged most of the time. Furthermore, the
frequently occurring cessations and reversals are caused by the system
switching between its two metastable states, i.e. thermal and viscous coupling
modes. It is also observed that the strength of the LSC in water becomes weaker
when the LSC in FC77 rotates faster azimuthally and that the flow strength in
FC77 becomes stronger when the LSC in water rotates faster azimuthally, i.e.
the influence of the LSC in one fluid layer on the other is not symmetric.

"Fluid forces or impacts: What governs the entrainment of soil particles
  in sediment transport mediated by a Newtonian fluid?",http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07306v7,"['Thomas PÃ¤htz', 'Orencio DurÃ¡n']","  In steady sediment transport, sediment deposition is balanced by entrainment
of bed particles by fluid forces or particle-bed impacts. Here we propose a
proxy to determine the role of impact entrainment relative to entrainment by
the mean turbulent flow: the ""bed velocity"" $V_b$, which is an effective
near-bed-surface value of the average horizontal particle velocity that
generalizes the classical slip velocity, used in studies of aeolian saltation
transport, to sediment transport in an arbitrary Newtonian fluid. We study
$V_b$ for a wide range of the particle-fluid-density ratio $s$, Galileo number
$\mathrm{Ga}$, and Shields number $\Theta$ using direct sediment transport
simulations. We find that transport is fully sustained through impact
entrainment (i.e., $V_b$ is constant in natural units) when the ""impact number""
$\mathrm{Im}=\mathrm{Ga}\sqrt{s+0.5}\gtrsim20$ or $\Theta\gtrsim5/\mathrm{Im}$.
These conditions are obeyed for the vast majority of transport regimes,
including steady turbulent bedload, which has long been thought to be sustained
solely through fluid entrainment. In fact, we find that transport is fully
sustained through fluid entrainment (i.e., $V_b$ scales with the near-bed
horizontal fluid velocity) only for sufficiently viscous bedload transport at
grain scale (i.e., for $\mathrm{Im}\lesssim20$ and
$\Theta\lesssim1/\mathrm{Im}$). Finally, we do not find a strong correlation
between, $V_b$, or the classical slip velocity, and the
transport-layer-averaged horizontal particle velocity $\overline{v_x}$, which
challenges the long-standing consensus that predominant impact entrainment is
responsible for a linear scaling of the transport rate with $\Theta$. For
turbulent bedload in particular, $\overline{v_x}$ increases with $\Theta$
despite $V_b$ remaining constant, which we propose is linked to the formation
of a liquid-like bed on top of the static-bed surface.

"Semigroup Well-posedness of A Linearized, Compressible Fluid with An
  Elastic Boundary",http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10855v2,"['George Avalos', 'Pelin G. Geredeli', 'Justin T. Webster']","  We address semigroup well-posedness of the fluid-structure interaction of a
linearized compressible, viscous fluid and an elastic plate (in the absence of
rotational inertia). Unlike existing work in the literature, we linearize the
compressible Navier-Stokes equations about an arbitrary state (assuming the
fluid is barotropic), and so the fluid PDE component of the interaction will
generally include a nontrivial ambient flow profile $ \mathbf{U}$. The
appearance of this term introduces new challenges at the level of the
stationary problem. In addition, the boundary of the fluid domain is
unavoidably Lipschitz, and so the well-posedness argument takes into account
the technical issues associated with obtaining necessary boundary trace and
elliptic regularity estimates. Much of the previous work on flow-plate models
was done via Galerkin-type constructions after obtaining good a priori
estimates on solutions (specifically \cite {Chu2013-comp}---the work most
pertinent to ours here); in contrast, we adopt here a Lumer-Phillips approach,
with a view of associating solutions of the fluid-structure dynamics with a
$C_{0}$-semigroup $\left\{ e^{ \mathcal{A}t}\right\} _{t\geq 0}$ on the natural
finite energy space of initial data. So, given this approach, the major
challenge in our work becomes establishing of the maximality of the operator
$\mathcal{A}$ which models the fluid-structure dynamics. In sum: our main
result is semigroup well-posedness for the fully coupled fluid-structure
dynamics, under the assumption that the ambient flow field $ \mathbf{U}\in
\mathbf{H}^{3}(\mathcal{O})$ has zero normal component trace on the boundary (a
standard assumption with respect to the literature). In the final sections we
address well-posedness of the system in the presence of the von Karman plate
nonlinearity, as well as the stationary problem associated with the dynamics.

A Definition of Vortex Vector and Vortex,http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03887v1,"['Shuling Tian', 'Yisheng Gao', 'Xiangrui Dong', 'Chaoqun Liu']","  Vortex is ubiquitous in nature. However, there is not a consensus on the
vortex definition in fluid dynamics. Lack of mathematical definition has caused
considerable confusions in visualizing and understanding the coherent vortical
structures in turbulence. According to previous study, it is realized that
vortex is not the vorticity tube and vorticity should be decomposed into a
rotational part which is the vortex vector and a non-rotational part which is
the shear. In this paper, several new concepts such as fluid rotation of local
point, the direction of fluid rotation axis and the strength of fluid rotation
are proposed by investigating the kinematics of fluid element in the 2D and 3D
flows. A definition of a new vector quantity called vortex vector is proposed
to describe the local fluid rotation. The direction of the vortex vector is
defined as the direction of local fluid rotation axis. The velocity components
in the plane orthogonal to the vortex vector have zero derivatives along the
vortex vector direction. The magnitude of the vortex vector is defined as the
rotational part of vorticity in the direction of the vortex vector, which is
the twice of the minimum angular velocity of fluid around the point among all
azimuth in the plane perpendicular to vortex vector. According to the
definition of the vortex vector, vortex is defined as a connected flow region
where the magnitude of the vortex vector at each point is larger than zero. The
new definition for the vortex vector and vortex follows three principles: 1.
Local in quantity, 2. Galilean invariant, 3. Unique. The definitions are
carefully checked by DNS and LES examples which clearly show that the new
defined vortex vector and vortex can fully represent the complex structures of
vortices in turbulence.

  porous flow model for rough surface contact",http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04004v1,"['Christoph Ager', 'Benedikt Schott', 'Anh-Tu Vuong', 'Alexander Popp', 'Wolfgang A. Wall']","  Simulation approaches for fluid-structure-contact interaction, especially if
requested to be consistent even down to the real contact scenarios, belong to
the most challenging and still unsolved problems in computational mechanics.
The main challenges are twofold - one is to have a correct physical model for
this scenario, and the other one is to have a numerical method that is capable
of working and being consistent down to a zero gap. And when analyzing such
challenging setups of fluid-structure interaction that include contact of
submersed solid components it gets obvious that the influence of surface
roughness effects is essential for a physical consistent modeling of such
configurations. To capture this system behavior, we present a continuum
mechanical model which is able to include the effects of the surface
microstructure in a fluid-structure-contact interaction framework. An averaged
representation for the mixture of fluid and solid on the rough surfaces, which
is of major interest for the macroscopic response of such a system, is
introduced therein. The inherent coupling of the macroscopic fluid flow and the
flow inside the rough surfaces, the stress exchange of all contacting solid
bodies involved, and the interaction between fluid and solid is included in the
construction of the model. Although the physical model is not restricted to
finite element based methods, a numerical approach with its core based on the
Cut Finite Element Method (CutFEM), enabling topological changes of the fluid
domain to solve the presented model numerically, is introduced. Such a CutFEM
based approach is able to deal with the numerical challenges mentioned above.
Different test cases give a perspective towards the potential capabilities of

  approach, reductions and integrability",http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04600v2,"['Rossen Ivanov', 'Vakhtang Putkaradze']","  Many engineering and physiological applications deal with situations when a
fluid is moving in flexible tubes with elastic walls. In the real-life
applications like blood flow, there is often an additional complexity of
vorticity being present in the fluid. We present a theory for the dynamics of
interaction of fluids and structures. The equations are derived using the
variational principle, with the incompressibility constraint of the fluid
giving rise to a pressure-like term. In order to connect this work with the
previous literature, we consider the case of inextensible and unshearable tube
with a straight centerline. In the absence of vorticity, our model reduces to
previous models considered in the literature, yielding the equations of
conservation of fluid momentum, wall momentum and the fluid volume. We show
that even when the vorticity is present, but is kept at a constant value, the
case of an inextensible, unshearable and straight tube with elastics walls
carrying a fluid allows an alternative formulation, reducing to a single
compact equation for the back-to-labels map instead of three conservation
equations. That single equation shows interesting instability in solutions when
the vorticity exceeds a certain threshold. Furthermore, the equation in stable

fluids with lower and higher yield stress is investigated at multiple Reynolds
numbers $Re^* \in$ (1, 200) and Bingham numbers $Bi \in$ (0.01, 0.35). A
secondary flow consisting of eight vortices is observed to recirculate the
fluid from the corners to the core. Their extent and intensity grows with
increasing $Re^*$. The second objective of this study is to explore the change
in flow in the presence of particles. Almost neutrally-buoyant finite-size
spherical particles with duct height, $2H$, to particle diameter, $d_p$, ratio
of 12 are used at two volume fractions $\phi$ = 5 and 10\%. Particle Tracking
Velocimetry (PTV) is used to measure the velocity of these
refractive-index-matched spheres, and PIV to extract the fluid velocity. Simple
shadowgraphy is also used for qualitatively visualising the development of the
particle distribution along the streamwise direction. The particle distribution
pattern changes from being concentrated at the four corners, at low flow rates,
to being focussed along a diffused ring between the center and the corners, at
high flow rates. The presence of particles induces streamwise and wall-normal
velocity fluctuations in the fluid phase; however, the primary Reynolds shear
stress is still very small compared to turbulent flows. The size of the plug in
the particle-laden cases appears to be smaller than the corresponding single
phase cases. Similar to Newtonian fluids, the friction factor increases due to
the presence of particles, almost independently of the suspending fluid matrix.
Interestingly, predictions based on an increased effective suspension viscosity
agrees quite well with the experimental friction factor for the concentrations
used in this study.

world models consisting of up to four non-interacting fluids, each with
pressure P, energy density epsilon and an equation of state P = (gamma - 1)

  In addition to repulsive fluids with negative pressure and positive energy
density, which generalize the classical repulsive (positive) Lambda component,

a negative Lambda component. This renders possible new types of models that do
not occur among the classical classifications of world models. Singularity-free
periodic solutions as well as further `hill-type', `hollow-type' and

Lambda fluid (with Lambda > 0) tends to yield the smoothest fits of the

Simulation studies of fluid critical behaviour,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9610133v1,['N. B. Wilding'],"  We review and discuss recent advances in the simulation of bulk critical

coexisting fluid phases. The consequences of this asymmetry for simulation
measurements of quantities such as the particle density and the heat capacity

simulation strategy based on the finite-size scaling theory is described and
its utility illustrated via Monte-Carlo studies of the Lennard-Jones fluid and
a two-dimensional spin fluid model. Recent applications to critical polymer
blends and solutions are also briefly reviewed. Finally we consider the outlook

Phase behaviour of a simple model of globular proteins,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9904426v2,['Richard P. Sear'],"  A simple model of globular proteins which incorporates anisotropic
attractions is proposed. It is closely related to models used to model simple
hydrogen-bonding molecules such as water. Theories for both the fluid and solid
phases are presented, and phase diagrams calculated. The model protein exhibits
a fluid-fluid transition which is metastable with respect to the fluid-solid
transition for most values of the model parameters. This is behaviour often
observed for globular proteins. The model offers an explanation of the
difficulty observed in crystallising some globular proteins and suggests that
some proteins may not have a solid phase at all under all but extreme

separated by sharply defined, but curved, interfaces: the resulting Laplace
pressure drives fluid flow. Scaling ideas (of Siggia and of Furukawa) predict
that, ultimately, this flow should become turbulent as inertial effects
dominate over viscous ones. The physics here is complex: mesoscale simulation
methods (such as Lattice Boltzmann and Dissipative Particle Dynamics) can play
an essential role in its elucidation, as we describe. Likewise, it is a matter
of experience that immiscible fluids will mix, on some lengthscale at least, if
stirred vigorously enough. A scaling theory (of Doi and Ohta) predicts the
dependence of a steady state domain size on shear rate, but assumes low
Reynolds number (inertia is neglected). Our preliminary simulation results
(three-dimensional, so far only on small systems) show little sign of the kind
of steady state envisaged by Doi and Ohta; they raise instead the possibility
of an oriented domain texture which can continue to coarsen until either
inertial effects, or (in our simulations) finite size effects, come into play.

The first analytical description of anomalous scaling laws in turbulence has
been obtained. The underlying physical mechanism reveals the role of
statistical integrals of motion in non-equilibrium systems. For turbulent
transport, the statistical conservation laws are hidden in the evolution of
groups of fluid particles and arise from the competition between the expansion
of a group and the change of its geometry. By breaking the scale-invariance
symmetry, the statistically conserved quantities lead to the observed anomalous
scaling of transported fields. Lagrangian methods also shed new light on some
practical issues, such as mixing and turbulent magnetic dynamo.

of perfect fluid solution which is static and inhomogeneous. The density and
pressure fall off in the curvature radial coordinates as $R^{-2}, $ for

a generalized form of Friedmann's equations governing the expansion factor of
spatially averaged portions of inhomogeneous cosmologies is derived. The
averaging problem for scalar quantities is condensed into the problem of
finding an `effective equation of state' including kinematical as well as
dynamical `backreaction' terms that measure the departure from a standard FLRW
cosmology. Applications of the averaged models are outlined including
radiation-dominated and scalar field cosmologies (inflationary and
dilaton/string cosmologies). In particular, the averaged equations show that
the averaged scalar curvature must generically change in the course of
structure formation, that an averaged inhomogeneous radiation cosmos does not
follow the evolution of the standard homogeneous-isotropic model, and that an
averaged inhomogeneous perfect fluid features kinematical `backreaction' terms
that, in some cases, act like a free scalar field source. The free scalar field
(dilaton) itself, modelled by a `stiff' fluid, is singled out as a special
inhomogeneous case where the averaged equations assume a simple form.

pipe: viscosity skews the velocity profile which enhances the shear dispersion;
whereas in faster flow centrifugal effects establish secondary flows that
reduce the shear dispersion. The two opposing effects cancel at a Reynolds
number of about 15. Interestingly, the torsion of the pipe seems to have very
little effect upon the flow or the dispersion, the curvature is by far the

decoupling the long-term flow of interest from the rapid viscous decay of the

thickness of the lubrication model is \emph{not} the initial physical fluid
thickness, but instead is modified by the initial lateral shear flow. With

  fluid",http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0601212v4,['Agung Budiyono'],"  We discuss two-dimensional Madelung fluid dynamics whose irrotational case
reduces into the Schr\""odinger equation for a free single particle. We show
that the self-trapped spinning-stationary Madelung fluid reported in the
previous paper can be analogically identified as an equilibrium thermodynamics
system. This is done by making correspondence between Shannon entropy over
Madelung density and internal energy to be defined in the main text,
respectively with thermal-entropy and thermal-internal energy of equilibrium
thermodynamics system. This leads us to identify a Madelung fluid analog of
thermal-temperature at the vanishing value of which the stationary Madelung
fluid will be no more spinning and is equal to the quantum mechanical ground
state of a particle trapped inside a cylindrical tube external potential.

Causal dissipative hydrodynamics for QGP fluid in 2+1 dimensions,http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.0134v2,['A. K. Chaudhuri'],"  In 2nd order causal dissipative theory, space-time evolution of QGP fluid is
studied in 2+1 dimensions. Relaxation equations for shear stress tensors are
solved simultaneously with the energy-momentum conservation equations.
Comparison of evolution of ideal and viscous QGP fluid, initialized under the
same conditions, e.g. same equilibration time, energy density and velocity
profile, indicate that in a viscous dynamics, energy density or temperature of
the fluid evolve slowly, than in an ideal fluid. Cooling gets slower as
viscosity increases. Transverse expansion also increases in a viscous dynamics.
For the first time we have also studied elliptic flow of 'quarks' in causal
viscous dynamics. It is shown that elliptic flow of quarks saturates due to
non-equilibrium correction to equilibrium distribution function, and can not be
mimicked by an ideal hydrodynamics.

to the lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods, basic aspects of the theory still remain
unchallenged. An unsolved theoretical issue is related to the construction of a
discrete kinetic theory which yields \textit{exactly} the fluid equations,
i.e., is non-asymptotic (here denoted as \textit{LB inverse kinetic theory}).
The purpose of this paper is theoretical and aims at developing an inverse
kinetic approach of this type. In principle infinite solutions exist to this
problem but the freedom can be exploited in order to meet important
requirements. In particular, the discrete kinetic theory can be defined so that
it yields exactly the fluid equation also for arbitrary non-equilibrium (but
suitably smooth) kinetic distribution functions and arbitrarily close to the
boundary of the fluid domain. Unlike previous entropic LB methods the theorem
can be obtained without functional constraints on the class of the initial
distribution functions. Possible realizations of the theory and asymptotic
approximations are provided which permit to determine the fluid equations
\textit{with prescribed accuracy.} As a result, asymptotic accuracy estimates
of customary LB approaches and comparisons with the Chorin artificial
compressibility method are discussed.

the symmetry of its stress-energy tensor, i.e., its invariance under Lorentz
boosts in a distinguished spatial direction (p_j=-\rho), which makes this fluid
essentially anisotropic and allows its density to evolve. Typical features of
homogeneous regular T-models are: the existence of a Killing horizon; beginning
of the cosmological evolution from a null bang at the horizon; the existence of
a regular static pre-bang region visible to cosmological observers; creation of
matter from anisotropic vacuum, accompanied by very rapid isotropization. We
study in detail the spherically symmetric regular T-models on the basis of a
general exact solution for a mixture of the vacuum fluid and dustlike matter

Simulation of fluid flow in hydrophobic rough microchannels,http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.3966v2,"['Christian Kunert', 'Jens Harting']","  Surface effects become important in microfluidic setups because the surface
to volume ratio becomes large. In such setups the surface roughness is not any
longer small compared to the length scale of the system and the wetting
properties of the wall have an important influence on the flow. However, the
knowledge about the interplay of surface roughness and hydrophobic
fluid-surface interaction is still very limited because these properties cannot
be decoupled easily in experiments.
  We investigate the problem by means of lattice Boltzmann (LB) simulations of
rough microchannels with a tunable fluid-wall interaction. We introduce an
``effective no-slip plane'' at an intermediate position between peaks and
valleys of the surface and observe how the position of the wall may change due
to surface roughness and hydrophobic interactions.
  We find that the position of the effective wall, in the case of a Gaussian
distributed roughness depends linearly on the width of the distribution.
Further we are able to show that roughness creates a non-linear effect on the
slip length for hydrophobic boundaries.

rapid growth at higher shear rates. With increasing fluid density, the position
of the local minimum is shifted to lower shear rates. We found that the ratio
of the shear viscosity to the slip length, which defines the friction
coefficient at the liquid/solid interface, undergoes a transition from a nearly
constant value to the power law decay as a function of the slip velocity. In a
wide range of shear rates and fluid densities, the friction coefficient is
determined by the product of the value of surface induced peak in the structure

impulses from the bath. Those impulses, which induce stochastic transitions in

because the bath is also at equilibrium. Under continuous shear, the fluid
element adopts a non-equilibrium steady state. Because the surrounding bath of
fluid under shear is also in a non-equilibrium steady state, the system
receives stochastic impulses with a non-equilibrium distribution. Those

converted to bulk kinetic energy; at late enough times, the assumption of
relativistic temperatures becomes invalid. Here we present a new self-similar

particle velocity. Our result is that a small (large) degree of recirculation
is associated with a decrease (increase) of streaming with respect to a
quiescent fluid. The presence of this effect is confirmed numerically, away
from the perturbative limit. Our approach also allows us to calculate the
explicit expression for the eddy diffusivity, and to compare the efficiency of
diffusive and ballistic transport.

discuss the scattering cross section of light by the density fluctuations, and
find that in many situations it is small compared to the thermal fluctuations,
but not negligibly small and might be observable at room temperature. We also
consider a fluid in a squeezed state of phonons and fluids containing
boundaries. We suggest that the latter may be a useful analog model for better
understanding boundary effects in quantum field theory. In all cases involving
boundaries which we consider, the mean squared density fluctuations are reduced
by the presence of the boundary. This implies a reduction in the light

On discretization in time in simulations of particulate flows,http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.4588v1,"['Matthieu Hillairet', 'Alexei Lozinski', 'Marcela Szopos']","  We propose a time discretization scheme for a class of ordinary differential
equations arising in simulations of fluid/particle flows. The scheme is
intended to work robustly in the lubrication regime when the distance between
two particles immersed in the fluid or between a particle and the wall tends to
zero. The idea consists in introducing a small threshold for the particle-wall
distance below which the real trajectory of the particle is replaced by an
approximated one where the distance is kept equal to the threshold value. The
error of this approximation is estimated both theoretically and by numerical
experiments. Our time marching scheme can be easily incorporated into a full
simulation method where the velocity of the fluid is obtained by a numerical
solution to Stokes or Navier-Stokes equations. We also provide a derivation of
the asymptotic expansion for the lubrication force (used in our numerical
experiments) acting on a disk immersed in a Newtonian fluid and approaching the
wall. The method of this derivation is new and can be easily adapted to other
cases.

The Geometry of Non-Ideal Fluids,http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.2462v1,['S. G. Rajeev'],"  Arnold showed that the Euler equations of an ideal fluid describe geodesics
on the Lie algebra of incompressible vector fields. We generalize this to
fluids with dissipation and Gaussian random forcing. The dynamics is determined
by the structure constants of a Lie algebra, along with inner products defining
kinetic energy, Ohmic dissipation and the covariance of the forces. This allows
us to construct tractable toy models for fluid mechanics with a finite number
of degrees of freedom. We solve one of them to show how symmetries can be
broken spontaneously.In another direction, we derive a deterministic equation
that describes the most likely path connecting two points in the phase space of
a randomly forced system: this is a WKB approximation to the
Fokker-Plank-Kramer equation, analogous to the instantons of quantum theory.
Applied to hydrodynamics, we derive a PDE system for Navier-Stokes instantons.

Loose packings of frictional spheres,http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.0804v1,"['Greg R. Farrell', 'K. Michael Martini', 'Narayanan Menon']","  We have produced loose packings of cohesionless, frictional spheres by
sequential deposition of highly-spherical, monodisperse particles through a
fluid. By varying the properties of the fluid and the particles, we have
identified the Stokes number (St) - rather than the buoyancy of the particles
in the fluid - as the parameter controlling the approach to the loose packing
limit. The loose packing limit is attained at a threshold value of St at which
the kinetic energy of a particle impinging on the packing is fully dissipated
by the fluid. Thus, for cohesionless particles, the dynamics of the deposition
process, rather than the stability of the static packing, defines the random
loose packing limit. We have made direct measurements of the interparticle
friction in the fluid, and present an experimental measurement of the loose
packing volume fraction, \phi_{RLP}, as a function of the friction coefficient
\mu_s.

different external forces can be scaled onto a common curve. We try to explain
the nature of this curve on the basis of existing theoretical treatment where
either the no-slip condition is used or slip between fluid and substrate is
introduced. We find that of the eight cases under study, in five cases

"The electron effective mass in the strongly correlated 2D-uniform
  electron fluid from finite-temperature calculations",http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3349v1,['M. W. C. Dharma-wardana'],"  The very-low temperature thermal effective mass m* of paramagnetic and
ferromagnetic electrons in a uniform electron fluid in two dimensions is
studied. Analytical and numerical evaluations are used to meaningfully define
an m*, even in the the Hartree-Fock approximation. The Hartree-Fock m*
decreases linearly with the electron-disk radius r_s. Correlation effects lead
to strong cancellations between exchange and correlation. Thus the effective
mass is enhanced with increasing r_s for the unpolarized fluid, while m*
decreases with the r_s of the polarized fluid. The effective mass is calculated
from the coefficient of the quadratic temperature dependence of
exchange-correlation free energy F_{xc}. This is calculated in a physically
transparent manner using a new formula for the effective mass. This uses the
T=0 pair-distribution functions of Gori-Giorgi et al., and the temperature
derivative of a quantum analogue of the potential of mean-force well known in
the statistical mechanics of classical fluids. The results are compared with
recent quantum Monte-Carlo simulations at T=0, as well as with other available
experimental and theoretical data for the effective mass.

the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio of the fluid takes the universal

transition, in which the fluid passes from a dry to a filled state, where the

of the nematic molecules at the structured substrate and at the
isotropic-nematic interface, the filling transition may not exist, and the
fluid passes directly from a dry to a complete-wet state, with the interface
far from the substrate. More interestingly, in other situations, the complete
wetting transition may be prevented, and the fluid passes from a dry to a
filled state, and remains in this configuration, with the interface always
attached to the substrate, even for very large surface fields. Both transitions
are only observed for a same substrate in a narrow range of amplitudes.

magnetically-driven plate-like artificial cilia in microchannels using

magneto-mechanical solid-fluid computational model that captures the physical
interactions between the fluid flow, ciliary deformation and applied magnetic
field. When a rotating magnetic field is applied to super-paramagnetic
artificial cilia, they mimic the asymmetric motion of natural cilia, consisting
of an effective and recovery stroke. When a phase-difference is prescribed
between neighbouring cilia, metachronal waves develop. Due to the discrete
nature of the cilia, the metachronal waves change direction when the phase
difference becomes sufficiently large, resulting in antiplectic as well as
symplectic metachrony. We show that the fluid flow created by the artificial
cilia is significantly enhanced in the presence of metachronal waves and that
the fluid flow becomes unidirectional. Antiplectic metachrony is observed to
lead to a considerable enhancement in flow compared to symplectic metachrony,
when the cilia spacing is small. Obstruction of flow in the direction of the
effective stroke for the case of symplectic metachrony was found to be the key

construct state-dependent Lyapunov functions in contrast to path-wise

provide sufficient information that allow for a converse Lyapunov theorem. To
resolve this problem we introduce the class of strict GFN models by forcing the

GFN models we define a state-dependent Lyapunov and show that a converse

fluctuations can accelerate streamer branching. To track energies and locations
of single electrons in relevant regions, we have developed a 3D hybrid model
that couples a particle model in the region of high fields and low electron
densities with a fluid model in the rest of the domain. Here we validate our 3D
hybrid model on a 3D (super-)particle model for negative streamers in
overvolted gaps, and we show that it almost reaches the computational
efficiency of a 3D fluid model. We also show that the extended fluid model
approximates the particle and the hybrid model well until stochastic
fluctuations become important, while the classical fluid model underestimates
velocities and ionization densities. We compare density fluctuations and the
onset of branching between the models, and we compare the front velocities with
an analytical approximation.

collisions of microswimmers in a viscous fluid. We consider two self-propelled
spheres (microswimmers) moving towards each other in viscous fluid. We first
show that under commonly used no-slip boundary conditions on the fluid-solid
interface the microswimmers do not collide which is a generalization of the
well-known no-collision paradox for solid bodies (with no self-propulsion) in a

no-slip boundary conditions are replaced by the Navier boundary conditions
which therefore provides an adequate model of microswimmers such as swimming
bacteria. The self-propulsion mechanism generates a drag force pulling a
bacterium backwards and the collision problem is reduced to the analysis of
competition between the drag and self-propulsion. For no-slip this is done by
utilizing the Lorentz Reciprocal Theorem and the analytical solution for two
solid spheres in the fluid. The analysis for the Navier boundary conditions is
based on the variational formulation of Stokes problem. A Poincare type

between the two fluids and the wall. We find a good agreement between the two
models particularly for small capillary numbers. When the solid plate moves
fast enough, the entrainment of one fluid into the other one can occur. The
extension of the lubrication model to the case of a non-zero air viscosity, as
developed here, allows us to study the dependence of the critical capillary
number for air entrainment on the other parameters in the problem (contact

The incompressible fluid revisited: vortex-sound interactions,http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3289v1,"['Solomon Endlich', 'Alberto Nicolis']","  We study the dynamics of a nearly incompressible fluid via (classical)
effective field theory. In the kinematical regime corresponding to near
incompressibility (small fluid velocities and accelerations), compressional
modes are, by definition, difficult to excite, and can be dealt with
perturbatively. We systematically outline the corresponding perturbative
expansion, which can be thought of as an expansion in the ratio of fluid
velocity and speed of sound. Our analysis is fully relativistic, but, if
desired, the non-relativistic limit can be taken at any stage. We demonstrate
the potential of our method by some sample calculations: the relativistic
corrections to the emission and to the scattering of sound by vorticose
(possibly turbulent) motions, and, more interestingly, the vortex-vortex long
range interaction mediated by sound. These results are, to our knowledge, new.
For the last one, we find a 1/r^3 potential between localized vortex
configurations (e.g., vortex rings), whose strength and detailed structure
depend on a certain multipole moment of the vortices under consideration. We
also improve on the so-called vortex filament model, by providing a local field
theory describing the dynamics of vortex-line systems and their interaction
with sound, to all orders in perturbation theory.

Flow of Navier-Stokes Fluids in Cylindrical Elastic Tubes,http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.5734v1,['Taha Sochi'],"  Analytical expressions correlating the volumetric flow rate to the inlet and
outlet pressures are derived for the time-independent flow of Newtonian fluids
in cylindrically-shaped elastic tubes using a one-dimensional Navier-Stokes

elastic tubes are the equivalent of Poiseuille and Poiseuille-type expressions
for rigid tubes which were previously derived for the flow of Newtonian and
non-Newtonian fluids under various flow conditions. Formulae and procedures for
identifying the pressure field and tube geometric profile are also presented.
The results are validated by a finite element method implementation. Sensible

Universality versus nonuniversality in asymmetric fluid criticality,http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.2027v1,['M. A. Anisimov'],"  Critical phenomena in real fluids demonstrate a combination of universal
features caused by the divergence of long-range fluctuations of density and
nonuniversal (system-dependent) features associated with specific
intermolecular interactions. Asymptotically, all fluids belong to the
Ising-model class of universality. The asymptotic power laws for the
thermodynamic properties are described by two independent universal critical
exponents and by two independent nonuniversal critical amplitudes; other
critical amplitudes can be obtained by universal relations. The nonuniversal
critical parameters (critical temperature, pressure, and density) can be
absorbed in the property units. Nonasymptotic critical behavior of fluids can
be divided into two parts, symmetric (""Ising-like"") and asymmetric
(""fluid-like""). The symmetric nonasymptotic behavior contains a new universal
exponent (Wegner exponent) and the system-dependent crossover scale (Ginzburg
number) associated with the range of intermolecular interactions, while the
asymmetric features are generally described by an additional universal exponent
and by three nonasymptotic amplitudes associated with mixing of the physical
fields into the scaling fields.

the destruction of regular patterns of oscillons coincides with the emergence
of a complex fluid motion whose statistics are similar to that of
two-dimensional turbulence. We reveal that a lattice of oscillons generates

Viscous pumping inspired by flexible propulsion,http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.2534v1,"['Roger M. Arco', 'J. Rodrigo Velez-Cordero', 'Eric Lauga', 'Roberto Zenit']","  Fluid-suspended microorganisms have evolved different swimming and feeding
strategies in order to cope with an environment dominated by viscous effects.
For instance ciliated organisms rely on the collective motion of flexible
appendices to move and feed. By performing a non-reciprocal motion, flexible
filaments can produce a net propulsive force, or pump fluid, in the absence of
inertia. Inspired by such fundamental concept, we propose a strategy to produce
macroscopic pumping and mixing in creeping flow. We measure experimentally the
net motion of a Newtonian viscous fluid induced by the reciprocal motion of a
flapper. When the flapper is rigid no net motion is induced. In contrast, when
the flapper is made of a flexible material, a net fluid pumping is measured. We
quantify the effectiveness of this pumping strategy and show that optimal
pumping is achieved when the length of the flapper is on the same order as the
elasto-hydrodynamic penetration length. We finally discuss the possible
applications of flexible impellers in mixing operations at low Reynolds

relationship to the shear modulus of a glass and the viscosity of a fluid. To
this end we use computer simulations to calculate a correlation function of the

heterogeneous dynamics in glass-forming fluids. We show that in the glass the
shear modulus can be obtained from the long-time, small-q limit of $S_4(q;t)$.
By using scaling arguments, we argue that a four-point correlation length
$\xi_4(t)$ grows linearly in time in a glass and grows as $\sqrt{t}$ at long
times in a fluid, and we verify these results by analyzing $S_4(q;t)$ obtained
from simulations. For a viscoelastic fluid, the simulation results suggest that
the crossover to the long-time $\sqrt{t}$ growth of $\xi_4(t)$ occurs at a
characteristic decay time of the shear stress autocorrelation function. Using
this observation, we show that the amplitude of the long-time $\sqrt{t}$ growth
is proportional to $\sqrt{\eta}$ where $\eta$ is the viscosity of the fluid.

relativity as a bulk field, the boundary field theory is interpreted as fluid
of the N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma. The transport coefficients of
this plasma are computed via the AdS/CFT correspondence. Then, we prepare a
pair of gravitational fields on the bulk side and let them interact. We expect
that two-component fluid emerge on the CFT boundary side because the number of
metrics becomes double. However, the situation is rather complicated. The
interaction generates a massive graviton. This massive mode leads to the extra
divergences which are absent in the case of general relativity. Our first

Filling transitions in acute and open wedges,http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.05698v1,"['Alexandr MalijevskÃ½', 'Andrew O. Parry']","  We present numerical studies of first-order and continuous filling
transitions, in wedges of arbitrary opening angle $\psi$, using a microscopic
fundamental measure density functional model with short-ranged fluid-fluid

characteristic of the planar wall-fluid interface is always first-order
regardless of the strength of the wall-fluid potential $\varepsilon_w$. In the
wedge geometry however the order of the filling transition depends not only on
$\varepsilon_w$ but also the opening angle $\psi$. In particular we show that
even if the wetting transition is strongly first-order the filling transition
is continuous for sufficient acute wedges. We show further that the change in
the order of the transition occurs via a tricritical point as opposed to a
critical-end point. These results extend previous effective Hamiltonian

the relations between the line-thermodynamic properties referred to different

a simple application of these results, I analyze the properties of the confined

behavior of the line thermodynamic properties is analytically studied up to
order two in the density for $0<\alpha<2\pi$ and by adopting different

delays the onset of instability in buoyantly unstable miscible fluids. Further,
it is observed that suitably choosing the viscosity contrast and injection
velocity a gravitationally unstable miscible interface can be stabilized
completely. Through LSA we draw a phase diagram, which shows three distinct
stability regions in a parameter space spanned by the displacement velocity and
the viscosity contrast. DNS are performed corresponding to parameters from each

a rigid sphere for the body and a time-dependent moving Stokeslet representing
the flagella. We analyze the paths of idealized fluid particles displaced by
the swimmer. The simplicity of the model allows some asymptotic calculations
very near and far away from the swimmer. The displacements of particles near
the swimmer diverge in a manner similar to an isolated no-slip sphere, but with
a smaller coefficient due to the action of the flagellum. Far from the swimmer,
the time dependence becomes negligible due to both being very fast and decaying
with distance. Finally, we compute the probability distribution of particle
displacements, and find that our model has fatter tails than previous steady
models, due to the presence of a no-slip surface that drags particles along.

of an aircraft. The towed plate permits visualisation of the
zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer as it develops from the trip to
a high Reynolds number state ($Re_\tau \approx 3000$). An evolving large-scale
coherent structure will appear almost stationary in this frame of reference.
The visualisations provide an unique view of the evolution of fundamental
processes in the boundary layer (such as interfacial bulging, entrainment,
vortical motions, etc.). In the more traditional laboratory frame of reference,
in which fluid passes over a stationary body, it is difficult to observe the
full evolution and lifetime of turbulent coherent structures. An equivalent
experiment in a wind/water-tunnel would require a camera and laser that moves
with the flow, effectively `chasing' eddies as they advect downstream.

Coupling Onset of Cyclone Upward and Rotation Flows in a Little Bottle,http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.7872v1,['Shigeo Kawata'],"  A coupling onset of the cyclone upward and rotation flows is experimentally
demonstrated in a little bottle. The rotating flow provides a pressure increase
in the outer part of the rotating flow by its centrifugal force. When a
gradient of the fluid rotation appears along the rotation axis, the
higher-pressure area is localized and pushes the fluid in a low pressure. Then
the fluid staying in the central area of the rotation is pushed up along the
rotation axis, and the upward wind is enhanced. In this coupling mechanism the
rotation gradient is the key; the coupling of the rotation and the upward fluid
flow is essentially important for a cyclone buildup, and is well explained
experimentally and theoretically.

an axisymmetric rigid near-sphere oscillating in a quiescent fluid along a
direction perpendicular to its symmetry axis. The kinematics of oscillations
can be either prescribed or can result dynamically from the presence of an
external oscillating velocity field. Steady streaming in the fluid, the
inertial rectification of the time-periodic oscillating flow, generates steady
stresses on the particle which, in general, do not average to zero, resulting
in a finite propulsion speed along the axis of the symmetry of the particle and
perpendicular to the oscillation direction. Our derivation of the propulsion
speed is obtained at leading order in the Reynolds number and the deviation of
the shape from that of a sphere. The results of our model are consistent with
the experimental measurements, and more generally explains how time periodic
forcing from an acoustic field can be harnessed to generate autonomous motion.

Kelvin's circulation theorem implies that initially irrotational flows remain
irrotational. Applied to numerical relativity, these concepts lead to novel
Hamiltonian or Hamilton-Jacobi schemes for evolving relativistic fluid flows.

symplecticity, and moreover do not require addition of an artificial atmosphere

random choice method and establish a global-in-time existence theory for the
initial value problem within the proposed class of weakly regular fluid flows.
The initial data may have arbitrary large bounded variation and can possibly
blow up near the horizon of the black hole. Furthermore, we study the class of
possibly discontinuous, equilibrium solutions and design a version of the
random choice method in which these fluid equilibria are exactly preserved.
This leads us to a nonlinear stability property for fluid equilibria under
small perturbations with bounded variation. Furthermore, we can also encompass
several limiting regimes (stiff matter, non-relativistic flows, extremal black
hole) by letting the physical parameters (mass of the black hole, light speed,
sound speed) reach extremal values.

configurations of relativistic fluids to the first two non-trivial orders in a

fluid are described by a thermal partition function with arbitrary stationary
background metric and gauge fields, we are able to find several constraints
among surface transport coefficients. At leading order, besides recovering the
surface thermodynamics, we obtain a generalization of the Young-Laplace
equation for relativistic fluid surfaces, by considering a temperature
dependence in the surface tension, which is further generalized in the context
of superfluids. At the next order, for uncharged fluids in 3+1 dimensions, we
show that besides the 3 independent bulk transport coefficients previously
known, a generic localized configuration is characterized by 3 additional
surface transport coefficients, one of which may be identified with the surface
modulus of rigidity. Finally, as an application, we study the effect of
temperature dependence of surface tension on some explicit examples of
localized fluid configurations, which are dual to certain non-trivial black

oblique for guide fields larger than the reconnecting field, in agreement with

introducing periodicity into the system has a surprisingly significant effect,

"Enhanced conservation properties of Vlasov codes through coupling with
  conservative fluid models",http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00367v1,"['T. Trost', 'S. Lautenbach', 'R. Grauer']","  Many phenomena in collisionless plasma physics require a kinetic description.
The evolution of the phase space density can be modeled by means of the Vlasov
equation, which has to be solved numerically in most of the relevant cases. One
of the problems that often arise in such simulations is the violation of
important physical conservation laws. Numerical diffusion in phase space
translates into unphysical heating, which can increase the overall energy
significantly, depending on the time scale and the plasma regime. In this
paper, a general and straightforward way of improving conservation properties
of Vlasov schemes is presented that can potentially be applied to a variety of
different codes. The basic idea is to use fluid models with good conservation
properties for correcting kinetic models. The higher moments that are missing
in the fluid models are provided by the kinetic codes, so that both kinetic and
fluid codes compensate the weaknesses of each other in a closed feedback loop.

Shallow-water models for a vibrating fluid,http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04378v1,['Konstantin Ilin'],"  We consider a layer of an inviscid fluid with free surface which is subject
to vertical high-frequency vibrations. We derive three asymptotic systems of
equations that describe slowly evolving (in comparison with the vibration
frequency) free-surface waves. The first set of equations is obtained without
assuming that the waves are long. These equations are as difficult to solve as
the exact equations for irrotational water waves in a non-vibrating fluid. The
other two models describe long waves. These models are obtained under two
different assumptions about the amplitude of the vibration. Surprisingly, the
governing equations have exactly the same form in both cases (up to
interpretation of some constants). These equations reduce to the standard
dispersionless shallow-water equations if the vibration is absent, and the
vibration manifests itself via an additional term which makes the equations
dispersive and, for small-amplitude waves, is similar to the term that would
appear if surface tension were taken into account. We show that our dispersive
shallow water equations have both solitary and periodic travelling waves
solutions and discuss an analogy between these solutions and travelling
capillary-gravity waves in a non-vibrating fluid.

incompressible fluids in a cylindrical domain, which are separated by a sharp
interface. In case that the heavy fluid is situated on top of the light fluid,
one expects that the fluid on top sags down into the lower phase. This effect
is known as the Rayleigh-Taylor-Instability. We present a rather complete
analysis of the corresponding free boundary problem which involves a contact
angle. Our main result implies the existence of a critical surface tension with
the following property. In case that the surface tension of the interface
separating the two fluids is smaller than the critical surface tension, one has
Rayleigh-Taylor-Instability. On the contrary, if the interface has a greater
surface tension than the critical value, the instability effect does not occur
and one has exponential stability of a flat interface. The last part of this

The laminar-to-turbulent transition in viscous fluid flow,http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07223v1,['A. Paglietti'],"  The onset of turbulence in laminar flow of viscous fluids is shown to be a
consequence of the limited capacity of the fluid to withstand shear stress.
This fact is exploited to predict the flow velocity at which laminar flow
becomes turbulent and to calculate, on a theoretical basis, the corresponding
critical value of the Reynolds number. A constitutive property essential to the
present analysis is the ultimate shear stress of the fluid. The paper shows how
this stress can be determined experimentally from a test in plane Couette flow.
For water at 20 {\deg}C, the value of the ultimate shear stress is calculated
from the experiments reported in the literature. This value is then is employed
to predict the Reynolds number corresponding to the onset of turbulence in
Taylor-Couette flow and in pipe flow of circular cross section. The results are
realistic and their significance is assessed critically. The procedure can be
applied to predict the onset of turbulence in any non-turbulent flow, provided
that the velocity field of the flow is known.

Marangoni stress due to surfactant introduced on a fluid interface at a
constant rate. Two separate extreme cases, where the surfactant dynamics is
dominated by the adsorbed phase or the dissolved phase are considered. We focus
on the case where the size of the surfactant source is much smaller than the
size of the fluid domain, and the resulting Marangoni stress overwhelms viscous
forces so that the flow is strongest in a boundary layer close to the
interface. We derive the resulting flow in a region much larger than the
surfactant source but smaller than the domain size is described by
approximating it with a self-similar profile. The radially outward component of
fluid velocity decays with the radial distance $r$ as $r^{-3/5}$ when the
surfactant spreads in an adsorbed phase, and as $r^{-1}$ when it spreads in a
dissolved phase. Universal flow profiles that are independent of the system
parameters emerge in both the cases. Three hydrodynamic signatures are
identified to distinguish between the two cases and verify the applicability of

Structuring of fluid adlayers upon ongoing unimolecular adsorption,http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05843v2,['Charley Schaefer'],"  Fluids with spatial density variations of single or mixed molecules play a
key role in biophysics, soft matter and materials science. The fluid structures
usually form via spinodal decomposition or nucleation following an
instantaneous destabilisation of the initially disordered fluid. However, in
practice an instantaneous quench is often not viable, and the rate of
destabilisation may be gradual rather than instantaneous. In this work we show
that the commonly used phenomenological descriptions of fluid structuring are
inadequate under these conditions. We come to that conclusion in the context of
surface catalysis, where we employ kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to describe
the unimolecular adsorption of gaseous molecules onto a metal surface. The
adsorbates diffuse at the surface and, as a consequence of lateral interactions
and due to an ongoing increase of the surface coverage, phase separate into
coexisting low- and high-density regions. The typical size of these regions
turns out to depend much more strongly on the rate of adsorption than predicted
from recently reported phenomenological models. We discuss how this finding

viscous fluid around equilibrium states under the action of a sinusoidal

containing both Stokes and memory-integral drag forces are obtained. The main
aim of this study is to clarify the influence of the memory-integral drag force
on the resonance characteristics of oscillating particles or gaseous bubbles in
a viscous fluid at small Reynolds numbers. The resonant curves (amplitude
versus frequency of external force), as well as phase-frequency dependences are
obtained for both these objects and compared with the corresponding dependences

Sessile drop on oscillating incline,http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02124v3,"['Ludovic De Maio', 'Francois Dunlop']","  Natural or industrial flows of a fluid often involve droplets or bubbles of
another fluid, pinned by physical or chemical impurities or by the roughness of
the bounding walls. Here we study numerically one drop pinned on a circular
hydrophilic patch, on an oscillating incline whose angle is proportional to
$\sin(\omega\,t)$. The resulting deformation of the drop is measured by the
displacement of its center of mass, which behaves like a driven over-damped
linear oscillator with amplitude $A(\omega)$ and phase lag $\varphi(\omega)$.
The phase lag is ${\cal O}(\omega)$ at small $\omega$ like a linear oscillator,
but the amplitude is ${\cal O}(\omega^{-1})$ at large $\omega$ instead of
${\cal O}(\omega^{-2})$ for a linear oscillator. A heuristic explanation is
given for this behaviour. The simulations were performed with the software
Comsol in mode Laminar Two-Phase Flow, Level Set, with fluid 1 as engine oil
and fluid 2 as water.

Frequency-dependent Hydrodynamic Interaction Between Two Solid Spheres,http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07804v2,"['Gerhard Jung', 'Friederike Schmid']","  Hydrodynamic interactions play an important role in many areas of soft matter
science. In simulations with implicit solvent, various techniques such as
Brownian or Stokesian dynamics explicitly include hydrodynamic interactions a
posteriori by using hydrodynamic diffusion tensors derived from the Stokes
equation. However, this equation assumes the interaction to be instantaneous
which is an idealized approximation and only valid on long time scales. In the
present paper, we go one step further and analyze the time-dependence of
hydrodynamic interactions in a compressible fluid on the basis of the
linearized Navier-Stokes equation. The theoretical results show that the
compressibility of the fluid has a significant impact on frequency-dependent
pair interactions.
  The predictions of the hydrodynamic theory are compared to molecular dynamics
simulations of two solid spheres in a Lennard-Jones fluid. For this system we
reconstruct memory functions by extending the inverse Volterra technique. The
simulation data agree very well with the theory, therefore, the theory can be
used to implement dynamically consistent hydrodynamic interactions in the
increasingly popular field of non-Markovian modeling.

Superfluid motion and drag-force cancellation in a fluid of light,http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03081v2,"['Claire Michel', 'Omar Boughdad', 'Mathias Albert', 'Pierre-Ãlie LarrÃ©', 'Matthieu Bellec']","  Quantum fluids of light merge many-body physics and nonlinear optics, through
the study of light propagation in a nonlinear medium under the shine of quantum
hydrodynamics. One of the most outstanding evidence of light behaving as an
interacting fluid is its ability to carry itself as a superfluid. Here, we
report a direct experimental detection of the transition to superfluidity in
the flow of a fluid of light past an obstacle in a bulk nonlinear crystal. In
this cavityless all- optical system, we extract a direct optical analog of the
drag force exerted by the fluid of light and measure the associated
displacement of the obstacle. Both quantities drop to zero in the superfluid
regime characterized by a suppression of long-range radiation from the
obstacle. The experimental capability to shape both the flow and the potential
landscape paves the way for simulation of quantum transport in complex systems.

Gassmann Theory Applies to Nanoporous Media,http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05216v2,"['Gennady Y. Gor', 'Boris Gurevich']","  Recent progress in extraction of unconventional hydrocarbon resources has
ignited the interest in the studies of nanoporous media. Since many
thermodynamic and mechanical properties of nanoscale solids and fluids differ
from the analogous bulk materials, it is not obvious whether wave propagation
in nanoporous media can be described using the same framework as in macroporous
media. Here we test the validity of Gassmann equation using two published sets
of ultrasonic measurements for a model nanoporous medium, Vycor glass,
saturated with two different fluids, argon and n-hexane. Predictions of the
Gassmann theory depend on the bulk and shear moduli of the dry samples, which
are known from ultrasonic measurements, and the bulk moduli of the solid and
fluid constituents. The solid bulk modulus can be estimated from
adsorption-induced deformation or from elastic effective medium theory. The
fluid modulus can be calculated according to the Tait-Murnaghan equation at the
solvation pressure in the pore. Substitution of these parameters into the
Gassmann equation provides predictions consistent with measured data. Our
findings set up a theoretical framework for investigation of fluid-saturated
nanoporous media using ultrasonic elastic wave propagation.

"Inertial self-propulsion of spherical microswimmers by
  rotation-translation coupling",http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10677v4,"['Itzhak Fouxon', 'Yizhar Or']","  We study swimming of small spherical particles who regulate fluid flow on
their surface by applying tangential squirming strokes. We derive translational
and rotational velocities for any given stroke which is not restricted by axial
symmetry as assumed usually. The formulation includes inertia of both the fluid
and the swimmer, motivated by inertia's relevance for large Volvox colonies. We
show that inertial contribution to mean speed comes from dynamic coupling
between translation and rotation, which occurs only for strokes that break
axial symmetry. Remarkably, this effect enables overcoming the scallop theorem
on impossibility of propulsion by time-reversible stroke. We study examples of
tangential strokes of axisymmetric travelling wave, and of asymmetric
time-reversible flapping. In the latter case, we find that inertia-driven mean
speed is optimized for flapping frequency and swimmer's size which fall well
within the range of realistic physical values for Volvox colonies. We
conjecture that similarly to Paramecium, large Volvox could use time-reversible
strokes for inertia-driven swimming coupled with their rotations.

homogeneously forced at small scale by a new forcing technique. The forcing is
random in both time and space within the fluid by using magnetic particles in
an alternating magnetic field. By measuring the growth rate of the fluid
temperature, we show how the dissipated power is governed by the external
control parameters (magnetic field, and number N of particles). We
experimentally found that the mean dissipated power scales linearly with these
parameters, as expected from the magnetic injected power scalings. These
experimental results are well described by simple scaling arguments showing
that the main origins of the energy dissipation are due to viscous turbulent
friction of particles within the fluid and to the inelasticity of collisions.
Finally, by measuring the particle collision statistics, we also show that the
particle velocity is independent of N, and is only fixed by the magnetic
""thermostat"".

"New equation for lagrangian incompressible fluid flows applied to
  turbulence",http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11378v1,['Olivier Poujade'],"  Theoretical developments in the field of Lagrangian turbulence are made
difficult by the fact that equations governing the evolution of lagrangian
flows are implicit contrary to eulerian flows. In this article, an {\it exact}
explicit equation for incompressible lagrangian fluid flows at high-Reynolds
number is constructed. The method to arrive at the equation of motion and the
proof that it describes the motion of an incompressible fluid are provided. A
truncated version of this new equation is used to show how the lagrangian
turbulent spectrum ($E_\mathrm{lag}(\omega)$) could be inferred. This exercise
showed a complex interrelation between the stirring force field and the flow
itself in the lagrangian turbulence framework whereas the stirring is not
affected by the flow in the eulerian point of view. The result is that
$E_\mathrm{lag}(\omega)\propto \varepsilon\,\omega^{-2}$ seems independent upon
the way the fluid is stirred in the inertial range for a given dissipated power
$\varepsilon$. It also showed that $E_\mathrm{lag}(\omega)\sim \omega^{-s}$
with $0\leq s\leq 1/2$ (depending on the stirring) at low-$\omega$ and
$\sim\omega^{-4}$ in the viscous range at high-$\omega$.

slightly higher growth rates than single-fluid MHD model, while for n $>$ 13

Nonlinear Dynamics of a Viscous Bubbly Fluid,http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11245v3,"['Ryan J. Thiessen', 'Alexei F. Cheviakov']","  A physical model of a three-dimensional flow of a viscous bubbly fluid in an
intermediate regime between bubble formation and breakage is presented. The
model is based on mechanics and thermodynamics of a single bubble coupled to
the dynamics of a viscous fluid as a whole, and takes into account multiple
physical effects, including gravity, viscosity, and surface tension.
Dimensionless versions of the resulting nonlinear model are obtained, and
values of dimensionless parameters are estimated for typical magma flows in
horizontal subaerial lava fields and vertical volcanic conduits.
  Exact solutions of the resulting system of nonlinear equations corresponding
to equilibrium flows and traveling waves are analyzed in the one-dimensional
setting. Generalized Su-Gardner-type perturbation analysis is employed to study
approximate solutions of the model in the long-wave ansatz. Simplified
nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) satisfied by the leading terms
of the perturbation solutions are systematically derived. It is shown that for
specific classes of perturbations, approximate solutions of the bubbly fluid
model arise from solutions of the classical diffusion, Burgers,
variable-coefficient Burgers, and Korteweg-de Vries equations.

This has implications for the use of sub-grid-scale lubrication models in
