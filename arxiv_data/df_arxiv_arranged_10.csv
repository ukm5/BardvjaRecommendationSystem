"Simulation of deterministic energy-balance particle agglomeration in
  turbulent liquid-solid flows",http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02346v1,"['Derrick O. Njobuenwu', 'Michael Fairweather']","  An efficient technique to simulate turbulent particle-laden flow at high mass
loadings within the four-way coupled simulation regime is presented. The
technique implements large eddy simulation, discrete phase simulation, a
deterministic treatment of inter-particle collisions and an energy-balanced
particle agglomeration model. The algorithm to detect inter-particle collisions
is such that the computational costs scale linearly with the number of
particles present in the computational domain. On detection of a collision,
particle agglomeration is tested based on the pre-collision kinetic energy,
restitution coefficient and the van der Waals' interactions. The performance of
the technique developed is tested by performing parametric studies of the
influence the restitution coefficient $(e_{n} = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6$ and $0.8)$,
particle size ($d_p = 60, 120, 200$ and $316 \mu{m}$), fluid inertia
($Re_{\tau} = 150, 300$ and $590$) and particle concentration ($\alpha_{p} =
5.0 \times 10^{-4}, 1.0 \times 10^{-3}$ and $5.0 \times 10^{-3}$) have on
particle-particle interaction events (collision and agglomeration). The results
demonstrate that the collision frequency shows a linear dependency on the
restitution coefficient, while the agglomeration rate shows an inverse
dependence. Collisions among smaller particles are more frequent and efficient
in forming agglomerates than those of coarser particles. The particle-particle
interaction events show a strong dependency on the shear Reynolds number
$Re_{\tau}$, while increasing the particle concentration effectively enhances
particle collision and agglomeration. Overall, the sensitivity of the
particle-particle interaction events to the selected simulation parameters is
found to influence the population and distribution of the primary particles and
agglomerates formed.

"Two-Particle Circular Billiards Versus Randomly Perturbed One-Particle
  Circular Billiards",http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3504v2,"['Sandra Ranković', 'Mason A. Porter']","  We study a two-particle circular billiard containing two finite-size circular
particles that collide elastically with the billiard boundary and with each
other. Such a two-particle circular billiard provides a clean example of an
""intermittent"" system. This billiard system behaves chaotically, but the time
scale on which chaos manifests can become arbitrarily long as the sizes of the
confined particles become smaller. The finite-time dynamics of this system
depends on the relative frequencies of (chaotic) particle-particle collisions
versus (integrable) particle-boundary collisions, and investigating these
dynamics is computationally intensive because of the long time scales involved.
To help improve understanding of such two-particle dynamics, we compare the
results of diagnostics used to measure chaotic dynamics for a two-particle
circular billiard with those computed for two types of one-particle circular
billiards in which a confined particle undergoes random perturbations.
Importantly, such one-particle approximations are much less computationally
demanding than the original two-particle system, and we expect them to yield
reasonable estimates of the extent of chaotic behavior in the two-particle
system when the sizes of confined particles are small. Our computations of
recurrence-rate coefficients, finite-time Lyapunov exponents, and
autocorrelation coefficients support this hypothesis and suggest that studying
randomly perturbed one-particle billiards has the potential to yield insights
into the aggregate properties of two-particle billiards, which are difficult to
investigate directly without enormous computation times (especially when the
sizes of the confined particles are small).

"Predicting the impact of particle-particle collisions on turbophoresis
  with a reduced number of computational particles",http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02869v1,['Perry L. Johnson'],"  A common feature of wall-bounded turbulent particle-laden flows is enhanced
particle concentrations in a thin layer near the wall due to a phenomenon known
as turbophoresis. Even at relatively low bulk volume fractions,
particle-particle collisions regulate turbophoresis in a critical way, making
simulations sensitive to collisional effects. Lagrangian tracking of every
particle in the flow can become computationally expensive when the physical
number of particles in the system is large. Artificially reducing the number of
particles in the simulation can mitigate the computational cost. When
particle-particle collisions are an important aspect determining the simulation
outcome, as in the case when turbophoresis plays an active role, simply
reducing the number of particles in the simulation significantly alters the
computed particle statistics. This paper introduces a computational particle
treatment for particle-particle collisions which reproduces the results of a
full simulation with a reduced number of particles. This is accomplished by
artificially enhancing the particle collision radius based on scaling laws for
the collision rates. The proposed method retains the use of deterministic
collision models and is applicable for both low and high Stokes number regimes.

One-Particle and Few-Particle Billiards,http://arxiv.org/abs/nlin/0508037v2,"['Steven Lansel', 'Mason A. Porter', 'Leonid A. Bunimovich']","  We study the dynamics of one-particle and few-particle billiard systems in
containers of various shapes. In few-particle systems, the particles collide
elastically both against the boundary and against each other. In the
one-particle case, we investigate the formation and destruction of resonance
islands in (generalized) mushroom billiards, which are a recently discovered
class of Hamiltonian systems with mixed regular-chaotic dynamics. In the
few-particle case, we compare the dynamics in container geometries whose
counterpart one-particle billiards are integrable, chaotic, and mixed. One of
our findings is that two-, three-, and four-particle billiards confined to
containers with integrable one-particle counterparts inherit some integrals of
motion and exhibit a regular partition of phase space into ergodic components
of positive measure. Therefore, the shape of a container matters not only for
noninteracting particles but also for interacting particles.

Identical Particles in Quantum Mechanics,http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.4642v2,['Andrea Lubberdink'],"  If, in a system of identical particles, the one particle state is defined by
the partial trace to one of the component spaces of the total Hilbert space,
then all one particle states are identical. The particles are
indistinguishable. This is often thought to be a typical quantum mechanical
phenomenon. I will show however that an analogous procedure to define particle
states exists in classical mechanics, which results in classical
indistinguishable identical particles. From this analogy it follows that the
indistinguishability of identical particles depends on how we define particle
states. It is not an inevitable result of the symmetry postulate.
  Indeed, if particles are defined by partial traces, consistent use of the
symmetry postulate leads to the conclusion that all identical particles in the
universe are indistinguishable, so that particles can never be pointed at, not
even in the classical limit. This does not correspond to the way the term
particle is actually used in practice. I will argue that a particle should be
defined in such a way that in the classical limit the quantum particle state
becomes the state of a classical particle. This will lead us to a definition of
particles which is in line with the way the term particle is actually used by
physicists.

removed. However, benchmark calculations indicate that a straightforward
combination of the two RPA channels does not lead to a successful computational

"The cost of swimming in generalized Newtonian fluids: Experiments with
  C. elegans",http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05811v1,"['David A. Gagnon', 'Paulo E. Arratia']","  Numerous natural processes are contingent on microorganisms' ability to swim
through fluids with non-Newtonian rheology. Here, we use the model organism
Caenorhabditis elegans and tracking methods to experimentally investigate the
dynamics of undulatory swimming in shear-thinning fluids. Theory and simulation
have proposed that the cost of swimming, or mechanical power, should be lower
in a shear-thinning fluid compared to a Newtonian fluid of the same zero-shear
viscosity. We aim to provide an experimental investigation into the cost of
swimming in a shear-thinning fluid from (i) an estimate of the mechanical power
of the swimmer and (ii) the viscous dissipation rate of the flow field, which
should yield equivalent results for a self-propelled low Reynolds number
swimmer. We find the cost of swimming in shear-thinning fluids is less than or
equal to the cost of swimming in Newtonian fluids of the same zero-shear
viscosity; furthermore, the cost of swimming in shear-thinning fluids scales
with a fluid's effective viscosity and can be predicted using fluid rheology
and simple swimming kinematics. Our results agree reasonably well with previous
theoretical predictions and provide a framework for understanding the cost of
swimming in generalized Newtonian fluids.
