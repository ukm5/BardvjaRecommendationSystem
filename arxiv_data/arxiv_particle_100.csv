"Predicting the impact of particle-particle collisions on turbophoresis
  with a reduced number of computational particles",http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02869v1,['Perry L. Johnson'],"  A common feature of wall-bounded turbulent particle-laden flows is enhanced
particle concentrations in a thin layer near the wall due to a phenomenon known
as turbophoresis. Even at relatively low bulk volume fractions,
particle-particle collisions regulate turbophoresis in a critical way, making
simulations sensitive to collisional effects. Lagrangian tracking of every
particle in the flow can become computationally expensive when the physical
number of particles in the system is large. Artificially reducing the number of
particles in the simulation can mitigate the computational cost. When
particle-particle collisions are an important aspect determining the simulation
outcome, as in the case when turbophoresis plays an active role, simply
reducing the number of particles in the simulation significantly alters the
computed particle statistics. This paper introduces a computational particle
treatment for particle-particle collisions which reproduces the results of a
full simulation with a reduced number of particles. This is accomplished by
artificially enhancing the particle collision radius based on scaling laws for
the collision rates. The proposed method retains the use of deterministic
collision models and is applicable for both low and high Stokes number regimes.

Identical Particles in Quantum Mechanics,http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.4642v2,['Andrea Lubberdink'],"  If, in a system of identical particles, the one particle state is defined by
the partial trace to one of the component spaces of the total Hilbert space,
then all one particle states are identical. The particles are
indistinguishable. This is often thought to be a typical quantum mechanical
phenomenon. I will show however that an analogous procedure to define particle
states exists in classical mechanics, which results in classical
indistinguishable identical particles. From this analogy it follows that the
indistinguishability of identical particles depends on how we define particle
states. It is not an inevitable result of the symmetry postulate.
  Indeed, if particles are defined by partial traces, consistent use of the
symmetry postulate leads to the conclusion that all identical particles in the
universe are indistinguishable, so that particles can never be pointed at, not
even in the classical limit. This does not correspond to the way the term
particle is actually used in practice. I will argue that a particle should be
defined in such a way that in the classical limit the quantum particle state
becomes the state of a classical particle. This will lead us to a definition of
particles which is in line with the way the term particle is actually used by
physicists.

one-particle case, we investigate the formation and destruction of resonance
islands in (generalized) mushroom billiards, which are a recently discovered
class of Hamiltonian systems with mixed regular-chaotic dynamics. In the
few-particle case, we compare the dynamics in container geometries whose
counterpart one-particle billiards are integrable, chaotic, and mixed. One of
our findings is that two-, three-, and four-particle billiards confined to
containers with integrable one-particle counterparts inherit some integrals of
motion and exhibit a regular partition of phase space into ergodic components
of positive measure. Therefore, the shape of a container matters not only for
noninteracting particles but also for interacting particles.

"Two-Particle Circular Billiards Versus Randomly Perturbed One-Particle
  Circular Billiards",http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3504v2,"['Sandra Ranković', 'Mason A. Porter']","  We study a two-particle circular billiard containing two finite-size circular
particles that collide elastically with the billiard boundary and with each
other. Such a two-particle circular billiard provides a clean example of an
""intermittent"" system. This billiard system behaves chaotically, but the time
scale on which chaos manifests can become arbitrarily long as the sizes of the
confined particles become smaller. The finite-time dynamics of this system
depends on the relative frequencies of (chaotic) particle-particle collisions
versus (integrable) particle-boundary collisions, and investigating these
dynamics is computationally intensive because of the long time scales involved.
To help improve understanding of such two-particle dynamics, we compare the
results of diagnostics used to measure chaotic dynamics for a two-particle
circular billiard with those computed for two types of one-particle circular
billiards in which a confined particle undergoes random perturbations.
Importantly, such one-particle approximations are much less computationally
demanding than the original two-particle system, and we expect them to yield
reasonable estimates of the extent of chaotic behavior in the two-particle
system when the sizes of confined particles are small. Our computations of
recurrence-rate coefficients, finite-time Lyapunov exponents, and
autocorrelation coefficients support this hypothesis and suggest that studying
randomly perturbed one-particle billiards has the potential to yield insights
into the aggregate properties of two-particle billiards, which are difficult to
investigate directly without enormous computation times (especially when the
sizes of the confined particles are small).

"Simulation of deterministic energy-balance particle agglomeration in
  turbulent liquid-solid flows",http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02346v1,"['Derrick O. Njobuenwu', 'Michael Fairweather']","  An efficient technique to simulate turbulent particle-laden flow at high mass
loadings within the four-way coupled simulation regime is presented. The
technique implements large eddy simulation, discrete phase simulation, a
deterministic treatment of inter-particle collisions and an energy-balanced
particle agglomeration model. The algorithm to detect inter-particle collisions
is such that the computational costs scale linearly with the number of
particles present in the computational domain. On detection of a collision,
particle agglomeration is tested based on the pre-collision kinetic energy,
restitution coefficient and the van der Waals' interactions. The performance of
the technique developed is tested by performing parametric studies of the
influence the restitution coefficient $(e_{n} = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6$ and $0.8)$,
particle size ($d_p = 60, 120, 200$ and $316 \mu{m}$), fluid inertia

5.0 \times 10^{-4}, 1.0 \times 10^{-3}$ and $5.0 \times 10^{-3}$) have on
particle-particle interaction events (collision and agglomeration). The results
demonstrate that the collision frequency shows a linear dependency on the
restitution coefficient, while the agglomeration rate shows an inverse
dependence. Collisions among smaller particles are more frequent and efficient
in forming agglomerates than those of coarser particles. The particle-particle
interaction events show a strong dependency on the shear Reynolds number
$Re_{\tau}$, while increasing the particle concentration effectively enhances
particle collision and agglomeration. Overall, the sensitivity of the
particle-particle interaction events to the selected simulation parameters is
found to influence the population and distribution of the primary particles and
agglomerates formed.

resistance coefficient. We find that for small particle-wall separations $h_0$,
the resistance coefficient tends to the asymptotic value corresponding to the
large particle moving in a clear suspending fluid. For $h_0<<a$, the resistance
coefficient approaches the lubrication value corresponding to a particle moving

multiple particles we show that the particles' dynamics can be vastly
different. Specifically, we show that a particle can become entangled with
another particle potentially causing the particle's trajectory to become

application, the real time behavior of particle flow fields is still not well

acquire in such harsh, opaque particle flow environments. In this educational
video for the Gallery of Fluid Motion, high speed video acquired with a new,
patented high speed particle imaging velocimetry (high speed PIV) technology is
presented. This technology was developed by the USDOE National Energy
Technology Laboratory (NETL). It is being applied to observe and measure the
real time behavior of individual particle motion inside particle flow fields of
high particle concentration for the first time. The high speed PIV system
records high speed videos of particle motion with excellent spatial and
temporal clarity. The high speed videos are analyzed to measure the
concentration and the two-dimensional motion (velocity and trajectory) of
individual particles. Data sample rates for velocity vectors are in the range
of 0.1 to 3 million vectors per second, thereby providing full resolution of
the temporal domain of particle velocity. To see and measure particle motion
inside the flow fields at high particle concentrations, a custom borescope is
inserted into particle flow fields.
  The particle tracking technique can measure gas and fluid flow if the
particles are small enough (have a low enough Stokes number) to follow the
gas/fluid flow. In areas of rapid mixing, such as turbulent wakes, particle
tracking can provide better spatial resolution that conventional

motions (LSMs) and very-large-scale motions (VLSMs) in an open channel flow at
a Reynolds number of $Re_\tau = 550$. One method of filtering the VLSMs from
the flow is via artificial domain truncation, which alters the mean particle
concentration profile and particle clustering due to the removal of VLSMs from
a large domain simulation. In order to exclude possible correlation of the
turbulence introduced by a small domain size with periodic boundary conditions,
low- and high-pass filtering is performed during the simulation to isolate the
particle interaction with different spatial scales. The results show that
particle accumulation and turbophoresis are under-predicted without VLSMs,
whereas the particle clustering and two-way coupling effects are mainly
determined by particle coupling with LSMs. In the inner layer, the elongated
streamwise anisotropic particle clustering can be reproduced by particles
coupling solely with LSMs for low Stokes number ($St_{LSM}=0.0625$) particles.
However, we do not observe similar particle clustering behavior in the outer
layer as seen in the full simulation by coupling particles with either LSMs or
VLSMs for high Stokes number ($St_{VLSM}=0.069$) particles. This indicates that
the organized particle structures are formed by the joint action of LSMs and

Particle Jet Formation During Explosive Dispersal,http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.3090v2,"['David L. Frost', 'Yann Grégoire', 'Sam Goroshin', 'Fan Zhang']","  Previous experimental studies have shown that when a layer of solid particles
is explosively dispersed, the particles often develop a non-uniform spatial
distribution. The instabilities within the particle bed and at the particle
layer interface likely form on the timescale of the shock propagation through
the particles. The mesoscale perturbations are manifested at later times in
experiments by the formation of coherent clusters of particles or jet-like
particle structures, which are aerodynamically stable. A number of different
mechanisms likely contribute to the jet formation including shock fracturing of
the particle bed and particle-particle interactions in the early stages of the
dense gas-particle flow. Aerodynamic wake effects at later times contribute to
maintaining the stability of the jets. The experiments shown in this fluid

illustrate the formation of particle jets during the explosive dispersal

1--100 MeV protons in composite 2D-slab turbulence superposed on a constant

direction, unlike when using spatial diffusion particle transport models. The
cross-field extent of the particle distribution remains constant for up to tens
of hours in turbulence environment consistent with the inner heliosphere during
solar energetic particle events. Subsequently, the particles escape from their
initial meandering field lines, and the particle propagation across the mean
field reaches time-asymptotic diffusion. Our analysis shows that in order to
understand solar energetic particle event origins, particle transport modelling

surfaces is vitally important in diverse situations and potentially controlled
by small-scale surface heterogeneity on the particle. Differences in the
behavior of patchy particles (flowing over uniform collectors) relative to the
reverse case of uniform particles (flowing over patchy collectors) are
quantified. Because a particle rotates more slowly than it translates in the
shear field near a collecting surface, the effective interaction time of a
patch on a particle is larger than that of a patch on the collector, suggesting
distinct particle capture tendencies in each case. This paper presents a new
computational approach to simulate the near-surface motion (rotation and
translation) of particles having nanoscale surface heterogeneities flowing over

Settling effects are seen at the lowest bulk Reynolds number $Re_{2H}\approx$

significantly larger than that of single-phase duct flow at the lower $Re_{2H}$

Quantum Entanglement of Identical Particles,http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0205069v5,['Yu Shi'],"  We consider entanglement in a system of fixed number of identical particles.
Since any operation should be symmetrized over all the identical particles and
there is the precondition that the spatial wave functions overlap, the meaning
of identical-particle entanglement is fundamentally different from that of
distinguishable particles. The identical-particle counterpart of the Schmidt
basis is shown to be the single-particle basis in which the one-particle
reduced density matrix is diagonal. But it does not play a special role in the
issue of entanglement, which depends on the single-particle basis chosen. The
nonfactorization due to (anti)symmetrization is naturally excluded by using the
(anti)symmetrized basis or, equivalently, the particle number representation.
The natural degrees of freedom in quantifying the identical-particle
entanglement in a chosen single-particle basis are occupation numbers of
different single particle basis states. The entanglement between effectively
distinguishable spins is shown to be a special case of the occupation-number
entanglement.

found to vary strongly with its position in the cluster, and a mean radiative
particle cooling term is proposed for single particle simulations of particle
clusters or for high detail simulation, like Direct Numerical Simulations of
small sub-volumes of large clusters of particles. Radiative cooling is shown to
be important both for furnaces for coal gasification and coal combustion.
Broadening the particle size distribution is found to have just a minor effect
on the radiative particle cooling. This is particularly the case for large and
dense particle clusters where there is essentially no effect of size
distribution broadening at all. For smaller and more dilute particle clusters,
the effect of distribution broadening is clear but still not dominant.

Squeeze expulsion in grain size segregation,http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07994v1,"['Lu Jing', 'C. Y. Kwok', 'Y. F. Leung']","  Grain segregation occurs under various conditions, such as vibration, shear
and mixing. In the gravity-driven shear flow, size segregation is triggered by
the percolation of small particles through the opened voids (kinetic sieving),
and large particles are accumulated in the upper layer. One hypothesis for the
upward migration of large particles is the squeeze expulsion mechanism, which
remains yet ambiguous due to limited evidences from either physical or
numerical experiments. Here we show statistically how the percolation of small
particles facilitates the upward movement of large particles. We found that in
large particles, the mechanical anisotropy (strong force network) coincides
with the geometric anisotropy (contact network), which indicates squeeze, and
the connectivity of large particles is much higher when they are squeezed
through small particles. The presence of small particles filling the voids
hinders the downward movements and provides dynamic steps for the climbing
large particles. Furthermore, increasing the coefficient of friction promotes
rotation and empowers more large particles to reach the top layer, implying
that the climbing particles tend to rotate relative to their neighbors. Our
findings of the microstructure and movement pattern of individual particles add
new evidences to the mechanism of squeeze expulsion and provide new perspective
for the study of segregation.

Adsorption of soft particles at fluid interfaces,http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06119v2,"['Robert W. Style', 'Lucio Isa', 'Eric R. Dufresne']","  Soft particles can be better emulsifiers than hard particles because they
stretch at fluid interfaces. This deformation can increase adsorption energies
by orders of magnitude relative to rigid particles. The deformation of a
particle at an interface is governed by a competition of bulk elasticity and
surface tension. When particles are partially wet by the two liquids,
deformation is localized within a material-dependent distance $L$ from the
contact line. At the contact line, the particle morphology is given by a
balance of surface tensions. When the particle radius $R \ll L$, the particle
adopts a lenticular shape identical to that of an adsorbed fluid droplet.
Particle deformations can be elastic or plastic, depending on the relative
values of the Young modulus, $E$, and yield stress, $\sigma_p$. When surface
tensions favour complete spreading of the particles at the interface, plastic
deformation can lead to unusual fried-egg morphologies. When deformable
particles have surface properties that are very similar to one liquid phase,
adsorption can be extremely sensitive to small changes of their affinity for
the other liquid phase. These findings have implications for the adsorption of
microgel particles at fluid interfaces and the performance of
stimuli-responsive Pickering emulsions.

designing addressable and functional self-organizing structures. These active

study a general setting of active particles in a bath of passive particles, and
demonstrate a novel mechanism for long range attraction between active
particles. The mechanism operates when the translational persistence length of
the active particle motion is smaller than the particle diameter. In this
limit, the system reduces to particles of higher diffusivity (""hot"" particles)
in a bath of particles with lower diffusivity (""cold"" particles). This
attractive interaction arises as a hot particle pushes cold particles away to
create a large hole around itself, and the holes interact via a depletion-like
attraction. Strikingly, the interaction range is more than an order of
magnitude larger than the particle radius, well beyond the range of
conventional depletion force. Although the mechanism occurs outside the
parameter regime of typical biological swimmers, the mechanism could be
realized in the laboratory.

director orientation on the particle surface undergoes a rapid transition from
uniform to homeotropic anchoring as a function of the anchoring strength and
the particle size. In the presence of a flow field, in addition to fluid
viscous stresses on the particle, nematic-induced elastic stresses are exerted
as a result of the anchoring conditions. The resulting forces are shown to
offer the possibility of size-based separation of individual particles. For
multi-particle systems, the nematic forces induce inter-particle attraction

  gradients",http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11018v1,"['Matthias Laumann', 'Walter Zimmermann']","  Microflows are intensively used for investigating and controlling the
dynamics of particles, including soft particles such as biological cells and
capsules. A classic result is the tank-treading motion of elliptically deformed
soft particles in linear shear flows, which do not migrate across straight
stream lines in the bulk. However, soft particles migrate across straight
streamlines in Poiseuille flows. In this work we describe a new mechanism of
cross-streamline migration of soft particles. If the viscosity varies
perpendicular to the stream lines then particles migrate across stream lines
towards regions of a lower viscosity, even in linear shear flows. An interplay
with the repulsive particle-boundary interaction causes then focusing of
particles in linear shear flows with the attractor stream line closer to the
wall in the low viscosity region. Viscosity variations perpendicular to the
stream lines in Poiseuille flows leads either to a shift of the particle
attractor or even to a splitting of particle attractors, which may give rise to
interesting applications for particle separation. The location of attracting
streamlines depend on the particle properties, like their size and elasticity.
The cross-stream migration induced by viscosity variations is explained by
analytical considerations, Stokesian dynamics simulations with a generalized

questioned the notion of particle in quantum field theory (QFT). For instance,
uniquely-defined particle states do not exist in general, in QFT on a curved
spacetime. More in general, particle states are difficult to define in a
background-independent quantum theory of gravity. These difficulties have lead
some to suggest that in general QFT should not be interpreted in terms of
particle states, but rather in terms of eigenstates of local operators. Still,
it is not obvious how to reconcile this view with the empirically-observed
ubiquitous particle-like behavior of quantum fields, apparent for instance in
experimental high-energy physics, or ""particle""-physics. Here we offer an
element of clarification by observing that already in flat space there exist

physical objects detected by finite-size particle detectors and are eigenstates
of local field operators. In the limit in which the particle detectors are
appropriately large, global and local particle states converge in a weak
topology (but not in norm). This observation has little relevance for
flat-space theories --it amounts to a reminder that there are boundary effects
in realistic detectors--; but is relevant for gravity. It reconciles the two
points of view mentioned above. More importantly, it provides a definition of
local particle state that remains well-defined even when the conventional
global particle states are not defined. This definition plays an important role

Identical quantum particles as distinguishable objects,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09280v1,"['Dennis Dieks', 'Andrea Lubberdink']","  According to classical physics particles are basic building blocks of the
world. Classical particles are distinguishable objects, individuated by
physical characteristics. By contrast, in quantum mechanics the standard view
is that particles of the same kind (""identical particles"") are in all
circumstances indistinguishable from each other. This indistinguishability
doctrine is motivated by the (anti)symmetrization postulates together with the
assumption (``factorism'') that each single particle is represented in exactly
one factor space in the tensor product Hilbert space of a many-particles
system.
  Although the factorist assumption is standard in the literature, it is
conceptually problematic. Particle indistinguishability is incompatible with
the everyday meaning of ``particle'', and also with how this term is used both
in classical physics and in the experimental practice of physics. The standard
view requires quantum particles of the same kind to remain indistinguishable
even in the classical limit, so that a transition to the classical picture of
the world seems impossible.
  Earlier we have proposed an alternative conception of quantum particles that
does not rely on factorism and that avoids these and other problems. We further
explain and develop this proposal here. In our view, particles in quantum
theory are not fundamental but \emph{emergent}. However, in those situations
where the particle concept is applicable, quantum particles---identical or
not---are distinguishable in the same way as classical particles.

The particle invariance in particle physics,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0110128v3,['H. Y. Cui'],"  Since the particles such as molecules, atoms and nuclei are composite
particles, it is important to recognize that physics must be invariant for the
composite particles and their constituent particles, this requirement is called
particle invariance in this paper. But difficulties arise immediately because
for fermion we use Dirac equation, for meson we use Klein-Gordon equation and
for classical particle we use Newtonian mechanics, while the connections
between these equations are quite indirect. Thus if the particle invariance is
held in physics, i.e., only one physical formalism exists for any particle, we
can expect to find out the differences between these equations by employing the
particle invariance. As the results, several new relationships between them are
found, the most important result is that the obstacles that cluttered the path
from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics are found, it becomes possible to
derive the quantum wave equations from relativistic mechanics after the
obstacles are removed. An improved model is proposed to gain a better
understanding on elementary particle interactions. This approach offers
enormous advantages, not only for giving the first physically reasonable
interpretation of quantum mechanics, but also for improving quark model.

Effects of Leakage Neutral Particles on Shocks,http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.4620v4,['Yutaka Ohira'],"  In this paper we investigate effects of neutral particles on shocks
propagating into the partially ionized medium. We find that for 120 km/s <

upstream neutral particles leak into the upstream region from the downstream
region. Moreover, we investigate how the leakage neutral particles affect the
upstream structure of the shock and particle accelerations. Using four fluid
approximations (upstream ions, upstream neutral particles, leakage neutral
particles and pickup ions), we provide analytical solutions of the precursor
structure due to leakage neutral particles. It is shown that the upstream flow
is decelerated in the precursor region and the shock compression ratio becomes
smaller than without leakage neutral particles, but the total compression ratio
does not change. Even if leakage of neutral particles is small (a few percents
of total upstream particles), this smaller compression ratio of the shock can
explain steep gamma-ray spectra from young supernova remnants. Furthermore,
leakage neutral particles could amplify the magnetic field and heat the
upstream region.

Visualizing Time-Varying Particle Flows with Diffusion Geometry,http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03686v1,"['Matthew Berger', 'Joshua A. Levine']","  The tasks of identifying separation structures and clusters in flow data are
fundamental to flow visualization. Significant work has been devoted to these
tasks in flow represented by vector fields, but there are unique challenges in
addressing these tasks for time-varying particle data. The unstructured nature
of particle data, nonuniform and sparse sampling, and the inability to access
arbitrary particles in space-time make it difficult to define separation and
clustering for particle data. We observe that weaker notions of separation and
clustering through continuous measures of these structures are meaningful when
coupled with user exploration. We achieve this goal by defining a measure of
particle similarity between pairs of particles. More specifically, separation
occurs when spatially-localized particles are dissimilar, while clustering is
characterized by sets of particles that are similar to one another. To be
robust to imperfections in sampling we use diffusion geometry to compute
particle similarity. Diffusion geometry is parameterized by a scale that allows
a user to explore separation and clustering in a continuous manner. We
illustrate the benefits of our technique on a variety of 2D and 3D flow
datasets, from particles integrated in fluid simulations based on time-varying

been used for designing adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithms in the
past years. We relate these assumptions to the movement patterns of particles
controlled by coefficient values (inertia weight and acceleration coefficient)
and introduce three factors, namely the autocorrelation of the particle
positions, the average movement distance of the particle in each iteration, and
the focus of the search, that describe these movement patterns. We show how
these factors represent movement patterns of a particle within a swarm and how
they are affected by particle coefficients (i.e., inertia weight and
acceleration coefficients). We derive equations that provide exact coefficient
values to guarantee achieving a desired movement pattern defined by these three
factors within a swarm. We then relate these movements to the searching
capability of particles and provide guideline for designing potentially
successful adaptive methods to control coefficients in particle swarm. Finally,
we propose a new simple time adaptive particle swarm and compare its results
with previous adaptive particle swarm approaches. Our experiments show that the
theoretical findings indeed provide a beneficial guideline for successful
adaptation of the coefficients in the particle swarm optimization algorithm.

relative orientation is the region in which one particle cannot be located due
to the presence of the other particle. The magnitude of the excluded area as a

determination of the bulk phase behaviour of hard particles. We use principal
component analysis to identify the different types of excluded area
corresponding to randomly generated two-dimensional hard particles modeled as
non-self-intersecting polygons and star lines (line segments radiating from a
common origin). Only three principal components are required to have an
excellent representation of the value of the excluded area as a function of the

equilibrium position are almost independent of the Reynolds number, while they
strongly depend on the particle elasticity; in particular, the migration is
faster as the elasticity increases (i.e. the particle is more deformable), with
the particle reaching the final equilibrium position at the centerline in
shorter times. Our simulations show that the results are not affected by the

properties or wave properties depending on the experimental set up

develop a state of spatially distributed coherently moving clusters. For
densities larger than a characteristic value clusters grow in time and form a

address two questions: (i) What is the role of the particles' aspect ratio in
the context of cluster formation, and does the particle shape affect the
system's behavior on hydrodynamic scales? (ii) To what extent does particle
conservation influence pattern formation? To answer these questions we suggest
a simple kinetic model permitting to depict some of the interaction properties
between freely moving particles and particles integrated in clusters. To this

Specifically, we account for coalescence of clusters from single particles,
assembly of single particles on existing clusters, collisions between clusters,
and cluster disassembly. Coarse-graining our kinetic model, (i) we demonstrate
that particle shape (i.e. aspect ratio) shifts the scale of the transition
density, but does not impact the instabilities at the ordering threshold. (ii)
We show that the validity of particle conservation determines the existence of
a longitudinal instability, which tends to amplify density heterogeneities
locally, and in turn triggers a wave pattern with wave vectors parallel to the
axis of macroscopic order. If the system is in contact with a particle
reservoir this instability vanishes due to a compensation of density

recent past, but our understanding of the dynamics of emulsion formation is
still limited. For simple spherical particles, the time dependent growth of
fluid domains is dominated by the formation of droplets, particle adsorption
and coalescence of droplets (Ostwald ripening), which eventually can be almost
fully blocked due to the presence of the particles. Ellipsoidal particles are
known to be more efficient stabilizers of fluid interfaces than spherical
particles and their anisotropic shape and the related additional rotational
degrees of freedom have an impact on the dynamics of emulsion formation. In
this paper, we investigate this point by means of simple model systems
consisting of a single ellipsoidal particle or a particle ensemble at a flat
interface as well as a particle ensemble at a spherical interface. By applying
combined multicomponent lattice Boltzmann and molecular dynamics simulations we
demonstrate that the anisotropic shape of ellipsoidal particles causes two
additional timescales to be of relevance in the dynamics of emulsion formation:
a relatively short timescale can be attributed to the adsorption of single
particles and the involved rotation of particles towards the interface. As soon
as the interface is jammed, however, capillary interactions between the
particles cause a local reordering on very long timescales leading to a
continuous change in the interface configuration and increase of interfacial
area. This effect can be utilized to counteract the thermodynamic instability
of particle stabilized emulsions and thus offers the possibility to produce
emulsions with exceptional stability.

that these particle sizes are clearly outside the range of validity of the
point-particle approximation, as has been shown by Homann & Bec (2010). At the
present parameter points the global effect of the particles upon the fluid flow
is weak. We observe that the dispersed phase exhibits clustering with moderate
intensity. The tendency to cluster, which was quantified in terms of the
standard deviation of Voronoi cell volumes, decreases with the particle
diameter. We have analyzed the relation between particle locations and the
location of intense vortical flow structures. The results do not reveal any
significant statistical correlation. Contrarily, we have detected a small but
statistically significant preferential location of particles with respect to
the `sticky points' proposed by Goto & Vassilicos (2008), i.e. points where the
fluid acceleration field is acting such as to increase the local particle
concentration in one-way coupled point-particle models under Stokes drag. The
presently found statistical correlation between the `sticky points' and the
particle locations further increases when focusing on regions with high local
concentration. Our results suggest that small finite-size particles can be

occurrences. For an object facing the front, it may yield various fates, from
trapping to rejection, with large implications regarding the solidification
pattern. However, whereas most situations involve multiple particles
interacting with each other and the front, attention has focused almost
exclusively on the interaction of a single, isolated object with the front.
Here we address experimentally the interaction of multiple particles with a
solidification front by performing solidification experiments of a monodisperse
particle suspension in a Hele-Shaw cell, with precise control of growth
conditions and real-time visualization. We evidence the growth of a particle
layer ahead of the front at a close-packing volume fraction and we document its
steady state value at various solidification velocities. We then extend single
particle models to the situation of multiple particles by taking into account
the additional force induced on an entering particle by viscous friction in the
compacted particle layer. By a force balance model, this provides an indirect
measure of the repelling mean thermomolecular pressure over a particle entering
the front. The presence of multiple particles is found to increase it following
a reduction of the thickness of the thin liquid film that separates particles
and front. We anticipate the findings reported here to provide a relevant basis
to understand many complex solidification situations in geophysics,

Stokes, Bertozzi (2013) by studying thin-film flows of mono-disperse
particle-laden fluid in helically-wound channels of arbitrary centreline
curvature and torsion, and arbitrary cross-sectional shape. In the case where
the particles are uniformly distributed through the depth of the film,
significant analytic progress can be made: the governing equations reduce to a
single nonlinear ordinary differential equation, which is readily integrated
numerically to obtain the solution subject to appropriate boundary conditions.
Motivated by possible application to the design of spiral separators, we
consider the effects of changing the channel centreline geometry, the
cross-sectional shape and the particle density on the resulting flows and the
radial distribution of particles. Our results support the findings in Arnold,
Stokes, Green (2016) regarding the effect of channel centreline geometry and
cross-sectional shape on flows in particle-free regions. In particle-rich
regions, similar effects are seen, although the primary velocity is lower due
to increased effective mixture viscosity. \ys{Of key interest, is the effect of
channel geometry on the focusing of the particles, for given fluxes of fluid
and particles. We find that introducing a trench into the channel
cross-section, a feature often used in commercial spiral particle separators,
leads to smaller radial width of the particle-rich region, i.e. sharper
focusing of the particles, which is consistent with experiments showing that
channel geometry influences particle separation in a spiral separator.

Effect of Particle Size on the Shear Strength Behavior of Sands,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09079v1,"['M. N. Islam', 'A. Siddika', 'M. B. Hossain', 'A. Rahman', 'M. A Asad']","  During plastic deformation of granular materials due to loading, the
stress-strain and strength characteristics of sand grains are influenced with
grain size, their distribution and packing. Also the macroscopic behaviour of
granular materials changes with the variation of microscopic behaviour.
Particle size is one of the important properties which plays a dominant role on
the stress, strain and strength responses of granular materials. Alteration of
grain size results in the change of void ratio as well as particle effective
contact area revolutionized and the load distribution mechanism of particle to
particle contact. To evaluate the effect of particle size, a series of direct
shear tests were performed considering uniform particles of eight samples
(0.075, 0.15, 0.212, 0.300, 0.600, 1.18, 1.72 and 2.76 mm) and graded particles
of two samples (0.075-1.18 mm and 0.075-2.36 mm). Three types of normal loads
(0.05, 0.10 and 0.15 kN) were selected for each test. For uniform particles,
particles retained on individual sieve size were considered and in graded
particles combination of each uniform particle pondered. A theoretical approach
was also proposed to correlate the particle size and macroscopic response. From
the experimental results, it was observed that for each set of normal load with
the increase of particle size ,angle of internal friction as well as maximum
horizontal shear stress increases for uniform sands and a similar response was
noticed in graded sands but the larger the gradation the higher the shear
strength. Maximum horizontal shear and angle of internal friction with respect
to particle size is also influenced by normal stress. Experimental results have
good agreement with the theoretical approach.

dominates acceleration by slow or fast modes when the spatial diffusion rate is
small. When the rate of spatial diffusion of particles is high, we establish an

forces requires the consideration of angular velocities of the dissipative

shown that the equilibrium statistical mechanics requirement that the linear
and angular velocity fields are Gaussian is sufficient to construct the random

similar in structure to the (isothermal) smoothed particle dynamics algorithm.
In this way, this work represents a generalization of smoothed particle
dynamics that incorporates consistently thermal fluctuations and exact angular
momentum conservation. It contains also the dissipative particle dynamics
algorithm as a special case. Finally, the kinetic theory of the dissipative
particles is derived and explicit expressions of the transport coefficients of
the fluid in terms of model parameters are obtained. This allows to discuss

tracked for mean durations of the order of 10 Kolmogorov time scales. The
fastest scales of the particle motion are resolved and the particle

matches the performance of the silicon strip detector technique introduced at

compared to that of slightly heavier solid particles (density 1.4) and to air

mixtures of Gaussian-core particles, focusing on how tracer diffusivities and
static pair correlations depend on temperature, particle concentration, and
composition. At low particle concentrations, these systems behave like simple
atomic mixtures. However, for intermediate concentrations, the single-particle
dynamics of the two species largely decouple, giving rise to the following
anomalous trends. Increasing either the concentration of the fluid (at fixed
composition) or the mole fraction of the larger particles (at fixed particle
concentration) enhances the tracer diffusivity of the larger particles, but
decreases that of the smaller particles. In fact, at sufficiently high particle
concentrations, the larger particles exhibit higher mobility than the smaller
particles. Each of these dynamic behaviors is accompanied by a corresponding
structural trend that characterizes how either concentration or composition
affects the strength of the static pair correlations. Specifically, the dynamic
trends observed here are consistent with a single empirical scaling law that
relates an appropriately normalized tracer diffusivity to its pair-correlation
contribution to the excess entropy.

Generation of Porous Particle Structures using the Void Expansion Method,http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.1201v1,"['Iwan Schenker', 'Frank T. Filser', 'Hans J. Herrmann', 'Ludwig J. Gauckler']","  The newly developed ""void expansion method"" allows for an efficient

until formation of a dense particle packing.
  The structural particles' mean coordination number was used to characterize
the evolving microstructures. At some void radius, a transition from an
initially low to a higher mean coordination number is found, which was used to
characterize the influence of the various simulation parameters. For structural
and void-particle stiffnesses of the same order of magnitude, the transition is
found at constant total volume fraction slightly below the random close packing

a smaller void-particle radius and becomes smoother.

  A formalism for particles on a periodic background is derived, applicable to
all one-dimensional cellular automata. One can compute which particles collide
and in how many ways. One can also compute the fate of a particle after an
unlimited number of collisions - whether they only produce other particles, or
the result is a growing structure that destroys the background pattern.
  For Rule 54, formulas for the four most common particles are given and all

particles are stable and which can be created, provided that only two particles
interact at a time. More complex behaviour of Rule 54 requires therefore
multi-particle collisions.

surrounding flow is introduced and used to construct the mean fluid velocity
profile around the particle. This leads to an estimate of the particle slipping
velocity and its associated Reynolds number. The flow modifications due to the
particle are then studied. The particle is responsible for a shadowing effect
that occurs in the wake up to distances of the order of its diameter: the
particle pacifies turbulent fluctuations and reduces the energy dissipation
rate compared to its average value in the bulk. Dimensional arguments are
presented to draw an analogy between particle effects on turbulence and wall
flows. Evidence is obtained on the presence of a logarithmic sublayer at
distances between the thickness of the viscous boundary layer and the particle
diameter $\Dp$. Finally, asymptotic arguments are used to relate the viscous
sublayer quantities to the particle size and the properties of the outer
turbulence. It is shown in particular that the skin-friction Reynolds number
behaves as $Re_\tau \propto (\Dp/\eta)^{4/3}$.

Optimum Size of Nanorods for Heating Application,http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0937v1,"['Gowrishankar Seshadri', 'Rochish Thaokar', 'Anurag Mehra']","  Magnetic nanoparticles (MNP's) have become increasingly important in heating
applications such as hyperthermia treatment of cancer due to their ability to
release heat when a remote external alternating magnetic field is applied. It
has been shown that the heating capability of such particles varies
significantly with the size of particles used. In this paper, we theoretically
evaluate the heating capability of rod-shaped MNP's and identify conditions
under which these particles display highest efficiency. For optimally sized
monodisperse particles, the power generated by rod-shaped particles is found to
be equal to that generated by spherical particles. However, for particles which
have a dispersion in size, rod-shaped particles are found to be more effective
in heating as a result of the greater spread in the power density distribution
curve. Additionally, for rod-shaped particles, a dispersion in the radius of
the particle contributes more to the reduction in loss power when compared to a
dispersion in the length. We further identify the optimum size, i.e the radius
and length of nanorods, given a bi-variate log-normal distribution of particle

more wettable phase is selectively adsorbed to the particle tail. Growths of
the adsorbed domains induce the hydrodynamic flow in the vicinity of the

Coordination game in bidirectional flow,http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02438v1,['Daichi Yanagisawa'],"  We have introduced evolutionary game dynamics to a one-dimensional
cellular-automaton to investigate evolution and maintenance of cooperative
avoiding behavior of self-driven particles in bidirectional flow. In our model,
there are two kinds of particles, which are right-going particles and
left-going particles. They often face opponent particles, so that they swerve
to the right or left stochastically in order to avoid conflicts. The particles
reinforce their preferences of the swerving direction after their successful
avoidance. The preference is also weakened by memory-loss effect.
  Result of our simulation indicates that cooperative avoiding behavior is
achieved, i.e., swerving directions of the particles are unified, when the
density of particles is close to 1/2 and the memory-loss rate is small.
Furthermore, when the right-going particles occupy the majority of the system,
we observe that their flow increases when the number of left-going particles,
which prevent the smooth movement of right-going particles, becomes large. It
is also investigated that the critical memory-loss rate of the cooperative
avoiding behavior strongly depends on the size of the system. Small system can
prolong the cooperative avoiding behavior in wider range of memory-loss rate
than large system.

Starting with a list of particle positions sampled at different time points, we
assign particle identities by minimizing the sum across all particles of the

to minimizing the stored energy in an elastic solid or the dissipated energy in
a viscous fluid. Our energy-minimizing approach extends the advantages of
particle tracking to situations where particle imaging velocimetry and digital
imaging correlation are typically required. This approach is much more reliable
than the standard squared-displacement minimizing approach for
spatially-correlated displacements that are larger than the typical
interparticle spacing. Thus, it is suitable for particles embedded in a
material undergoing large deformations. On the other hand, squared-displacement
minimization is more effective for particles undergoing uncorrelated random
motion. In the Supplement, we include a flexible MATLAB particle tracker that
implements either approach. This implementation returns an estimation of the

addition, there exist optimal parameters(the chirality, the height of the

Generally, the profiles strongly differ between particles leading and lagging

future developments that need to be addressed. In particular, the paper
addresses the issue of adhesion forces between complex surfaces - where more
detailed characterizations of adhesion force distributions are needed - and the
issue of particle sliding/rolling motion on the surface - which can lead to

practice, non-spherical particles are the main ingredient in sintering-based
processing techniques, like selective-laser-sintering, where their shape and
surface roughness influence the formation and development of inter-particle
contacts. Not only do particle-particle contacts influence the overall pore
surface curvature and thus the driving force behind the sintering process, but
they also affect the development of macroscopic properties, especially the
mechanical strength. To study the role of particle connectivity in the
sintering process, we propose a simple algorithm that generates random packings
of non-spherical particles in a wide range of particle connectivities. We
create irregular particle shapes by clustering three groups of spheres in three
separate stages that allow us to tune the shape and surface roughness of the
particles. Packings generated by our algorithm can be used both in simulations
and for printing prototypes that can be tested in real-time experiments.

Radial Flow of Dust Particles in Accretion Disks,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0208552v1,"['Taku Takeuchi', 'D. N. C. Lin']","  We study the radial migration of dust particles in accreting protostellar
disks analogous to the primordial solar nebula. This study takes account of the
two dimensional (radial and normal) structure of the disk gas, including the
effects of the variation in the gas velocity as a function of distance from the
midplane. It is shown that the dust component of disks accretes slower than the
gas component. At high altitude from the disk midplane, the gas rotates faster
than particles because of the inward pressure gradient force, and its drag
force causes particles to move outward in the radial direction. Viscous torque
induces the gas within a scale height from the disk midplane to flow outward,
carrying small (size < 100 micron at 10 AU) particles with it. Only particles
at intermediate altitude or with sufficiently large sizes (> 1 mm at 10 AU)
move inward. When the particles' radial velocities are averaged over the entire
vertical direction, particles have a net inward flux. At large distances from
the central star, particles migrate inward with a velocity much faster than the
gas accretion velocity. However, their inward velocity is reduced below that of
the gas in the inner regions of the disk. The rate of velocity decrease is a
function of the particles' size. While larger particles retain fast accretion
velocity until they approach closer to the star, 10 micron particles have
slower velocity than the gas in the most part of the disk (r < 100 AU). This
differential migration of particles causes the size fractionation. Dust disks
composed mostly of small particles (size < 10 micron) accrete slower than gas
disks, resulting in the increase in the dust-gas ratio during the gas accretion

to produce micrometer-sized water ice particles, i. e. by spraying water

nitrogen atmosphere. The mean particle radii of the ice particles produced with
these experimental methods are $(1.49 \pm 0.79) \, \mathrm{\mu m}$ and $(1.45

ice particles are highly porous (volume filling factor: $\phi = 0.11 \pm 0.01$)

in time (FIT) and backward in time (BIT) dispersion of fluid and inertial
particle pairs in isotropic turbulence. Fluid particles are known to separate
faster BIT than FIT in three-dimensional turbulence, and we find that inertial
particles do the same. However, we find that the irreversibility in the
inertial particle dispersion is in general much stronger than that for fluid
particles. For example, the ratio of the BIT to FIT mean-square separation can
be up to an order of magnitude larger for inertial particles than for the fluid
particles. We also find that for both the inertial and fluid particles the
irreversibility becomes stronger as the scale of their separation decreases.
Regarding the physical mechanism for the irreversibility, we argue that whereas
the irreversibility of fluid particle-pair dispersion can be understood in
terms of a directional bias arising from the energy transfer process in
turbulence, inertial particles experience an additional source of
irreversibility arising from the non-local contribution to their velocity
dynamics, a contribution which vanishes in the limit ${St\to0}$, where $St$ is
the particle Stokes number. For each given initial (final, in the backward in

the dispersion irreversibility is strongest, as such particles are optimally

the two-component accretion flow consisting of thermal particles and
high-energy particles, supposing that some fraction of the released energy is
converted to the acceleration of the high-energy particles. The thermal
component is governed by fluid dynamics while the high-energy particles obey
the moment equations of the diffusion-convection equation. By solving the time
evolution of these equations, we obtain advection dominated flows as the steady
state solutions. Effects of the high-energy particles on the flow structures
turn out to be small even if the pressure of the high-energy particles
dominates over the thermal pressure. For a model in which the escaping protons
take away almost all the released energy, the high-energy particles have large
influence enough to make the flow have the Keplerian angular velocity at the
inner region. We calculate the luminosities of the escaping particles for these
steady solutions. The escaping particles can extract the energy from about

dissipative scales influence their dynamics. In contrast, the mid-sized

The largest particles were largely unaffected by the flow conditions. Using
Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), the flow pattern scales are compared to
particle trajectory curvature to complement results obtained through
dimensional analysis using Stokes numbers. The smallest particles are found to
have trajectories with curvatures of similar scale as the small flow scales

popular tool for structural determination of biological macromolecular
complexes. High-resolution cryo-EM reconstruction often requires hundreds of
thousands of single-particle images. Particle extraction from experimental
micrographs thus can be laborious and presents a major practical bottleneck in
cryo-EM structural determination. Existing computational methods of particle
picking often use low-resolution templates as inputs for particle matching,
making it possible to cause reference-dependent bias. It is critical to develop
a highly efficient template-free method to automatically recognize particle
images from cryo-EM micrographs. Results: We developed a deep learning-based
algorithmic framework, DeepEM, for single-particle recognition from noisy
cryo-EM micrographs, enabling automated particle picking, selection and
verification in an integrated fashion. The kernel of DeepEM is built upon a
convolutional neural network (CNN) of eight layers, which can be recursively
trained to be highly ""knowledgeable"". Our approach exhibits improved
performance and high precision when tested on the standard KLH dataset.
Application of DeepEM to several challenging experimental cryo-EM datasets
demonstrates its capability in avoiding selection of un-wanted particles and
non-particles even when true particles contain fewer features. Conclusions: The
DeepEM method derived from a deep CNN allows automated particle extraction from
raw cryo-EM micrographs in the absence of templates, which demonstrated
improved performance, objectivity and accuracy. Application of this novel
approach is expected to free the labor involved in single-particle
verification, thus promoting the efficiency of cryo-EM data processing.

deposit at the outermost edge as compared to the larger diameter particles and
this preferential deposition in a stagnation region near the contact line is
due to the spatially-varying height of the liquid-gas interface above the

does not scale in such a self-similar way. The modification of the fluid
temperature field due to the particles is examined by computing the particle
concentration and particle heat fluxes conditioned on the magnitude of the
local fluid temperature gradient. These statistics highlight that the particles
cluster on the fluid temperature fronts, and the important role played by the
alignments of the particle velocity and the local fluid temperature gradient.
The temperature structure functions, which characterize the temperature
fluctuations across the scales of the flow, clearly show that the fluctuations
of the fluid temperature increments are monotonically suppressed in the two-way
coupled regime as the particle thermal response time is increased. Thermal
caustics dominate the particle temperature increments at small scales, that is,
particles that come into contact are likely to have very large differences in
their temperature. This is caused by the nonlocal thermal dynamics of the
particles...

"Exact regularized point particle (ERPP) method for particle-laden
  wall-bounded flows in the two-way coupling regime",http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08777v1,"['Francesco Battista', 'Jean-Paul Mollicone', 'Paolo Gualtieri', 'Roberta Messina', 'Carlo Massimo Casciola']","  The Exact Regularized Point Particle (ERPP) method is extended to treat the
interphase momentum coupling between particles and fluid in the presence of
walls by accounting for the vorticity generation due to the particles close to
solid boundaries. The ERPP method overcomes the limitations of other methods by
allowing the simulation of an extensive parameter space (Stokes number, mass
loading, particle-to-fluid density ratio and Reynolds number) and of particle
spatial distributions that are uneven (few particles per computational cell).
The enhanced ERPP method is explained in detail and validated by considering
the global impulse balance. In conditions when particles are located close to
the wall, a common scenario in wall-bounded turbulent flows, the main
contribution to the total impulse arises from the particle-induced vorticity at
the solid boundary. The method is applied to direct numerical simulations of
particle-laden turbulent pipe flow in the two-way coupling regime to address
the turbulence modulation. The effects of the mass loading, the Stokes number
and the particle-to-fluid density ratio are investigated. The drag is either
unaltered or increased by the particles with respect to the uncoupled case. No
drag reduction is found in the parameter space considered. The momentum stress
budget, which includes an extra stress contribution by the particles, provides
the rationale behind the drag behaviour. The extra stress produces a momentum
flux towards the wall that strongly modifies the viscous stress, the culprit of
drag at solid boundaries.

Encounter rates between bacteria and small sinking particles,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08376v1,"['Jonasz Słomka', 'Uria Alcolombri', 'Eleonora Secchi', 'Roman Stocker', 'Vicente I. Fernandez']","  Bacteria in aquatic environments often interact with particulate matter. A
key example is bacterial degradation of marine snow responsible for carbon
export from the upper ocean in the biological pump. The ecological interaction
between bacteria and sinking particles is regulated by their encounter rate,
which is therefore important to predict accurately in models of
bacteria-particle interactions. Models available to date cover the diffusive
encounter regime, valid for sinking particles larger than the typical run
length of a bacterium. The majority of sinking particles, however, are small,
and the encounter process is then ballistic rather than diffusive. In the
ballistic regime, the shear generated by the particle's motion can be important
in reorienting bacteria and thus determining the encounter rate, yet the effect
of shear is not captured in current encounter rate models. Here, we combine
analytical and numerical calculations to quantify the encounter rate between
sinking particles and non-motile or motile microorganisms in the ballistic
regime, explicitly accounting for the hydrodynamic shear created by the
particle and its coupling with microorganism shape. We complement results with
selected experiments on non-motile diatoms. We find that the shape-shear
coupling has a considerable effect on the encounter rate and encounter location
through the mechanisms of hydrodynamic focusing and screening, whereby
elongated microorganisms preferentially orient normally to the particle surface
downstream of the particle (focusing) and tangentially to the particle surface
upstream of the particle (screening). We study these mechanisms as a function
of the key dimensionless parameters: the ratio of particle sinking speed to
microorganism swimming speed, the ratio of particle radius to microorganism
length, and the microorganism's aspect ratio.

"Conditional stability of particle alignment in finite-Reynolds-number
  channel flow",http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08670v1,"['Anupam Gupta', 'Pascale Magaud', 'Christine Lafforgue', 'Micheline Abbas']","  Finite-size neutrally buoyant particles in a channel flow are known to
accumulate at specific equilibrium positions or spots in the channel
cross-section if the flow inertia is finite at the particle scale. Experiments
in different conduit geometries have shown that while reaching equilibrium
locations, particles tend also to align regularly in the streamwise direction.
In this paper, the Force Coupling Method was used to numerically investigate
the inertia-induced particle alignment, using square channel geometry. The
method was first shown to be suitable to capture the quasi-steady lift force
that leads to particle cross-streamline migration in channel flow. Then the
particle alignment in the flow direction was investigated by calculating the
particle relative trajectories as a function of flow inertia and of the ratio
between the particle size and channel hydraulic diameter. The flow streamlines
were examined around the freely rotating particles at equilibrium, revealing
stable small-scale vortices between aligned particles. The streamwise
inter-particle spacing between aligned particles at equilibrium was calculated
and compared to available experimental data in square channel flow (Gao {\it et
al.} Microfluidics and Nanofluidics {\bf 21}, 154 (2017)). The new result
highlighted by our numerical simulations is that the inter-particle spacing is
unconditionally stable only for a limited number of aligned particles in a
single train, the threshold number being dependent on the confinement
(particle-to-channel size ratio) and on the Reynolds number. For instance, when
the particle Reynolds number is $\approx1$ and the particle-to-channel height
size ratio is $\approx0.1$, the maximum number of stable aligned particles per
train is equal to 3. This agrees with statistics realized on the experiments of

A Multi-Species Asymmetric Exclusion Model with an Impurity,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0109429v1,['Farhad H Jafarpour'],"  A multi-species generalization of the Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process
(ASEP) has been considered in the presence of a single impurity on a ring. The
model describes particles hopping in one direction with stochastic dynamics and
hard core exclusion condition. The ordinary particles hop forward with their
characteristic hopping rates and fast particles can overtake slow ones with a
relative rate. The impurity, which is the slowest particle in the ensemble of
particles on the ring, hops in the same direction of the ordinary particles
with its intrinsic hopping rate and can be overtaken by ordinary particles with
a rate which is not necessarily a relative rate. We will show that the phase
diagram of the model can be obtained exactly. It turns out that the phase
structure of the model depends on the density distribution function of the
ordinary particles on the ring so that it can have either four phases or only
one. The mean speed of impurity and also the total current of the ordinary
particles are explicitly calculated in each phase. Using Monte Carlo
simulation, the density profile of the ordinary particles is also obtained. The
simulation data confirm all of the analytical calculations.

for stopping power is analyzed for three cases: (i) the particle moves through
a collisionless plasma in a strong homogeneous magnetic field; (ii) the fast

without a use of the principles of quantum mechanics. It is shown that the
Pauli particle S_P and the nonrelativistic approximation S_{nD} of the Dirac
particle S_D are different dynamic systems. S_{nD} contains the high frequency
degrees of freedom, which are absent in the dynamic system S_P. It means that
the nonrelativistic Dirac particle S_{nD} is composite (i.e. it has internal
degrees of freedom), whereas the Pauli particle S_P is a pointlike particle
with the spin. In the absence of the electromagnetic field the world line of
the classical Pauli particle S_{Pcl} is a timelike straight, whereas that of
the classical nonrelativistic Dirac particle S_{nDcl} is a helix. The
characteristic frequency $\Omega =2mc^{2}/\hbar $ of this helix is the

homogeneous turbulence and in simple flows which have a periodic or persistent
structure e.g. separating flows and mixing layers. The influence on both
settling under gravity and diffusion has been reported and the divergence
(compressibility) of the underlying particle velocity field along a particle
trajectory has been recognized as an important quantity in quantifying these
features. This paper shows how these features can be incorporated in a formal
way into a two-fluid model of the dispersed particle phase. In particular the
PDF equation for the particle velocity and position is formerly derived on the
basis of a stochastic process that involves the statistics of both the particle
velocity and local compressibility along particle trajectories. The PDF
equation gives rise to contributions to both the drift and particle diffusion
coefficient that depend upon the correlation of these quantities with the local
carrier flow velocity. Key Words: turbulent structures, particle dispersion,
drift, PDF approach

extensively for particle sorting and the analysis of particle properties. Using
the lattice Boltzmann method, we determine equilibrium positions in square and

we demonstrate how an axial control force, which slows down the particles,
shifts the stable equilibrium position towards the channel center. Ultimately,
the particles then stay on the centerline for forces exceeding a threshold

several test simulations to compare our method with a conventional splitting

smoothing length. We show that, with our method, the density deviation after
splitting is reduced by a factor of about two compared with the conventional
method. Splitting would smooth out the anisotropic density structure if the
daughters are distributed isotropically, but our scheme allows the daughter
particles to trace the original density distribution with length scales of the
mean separation of their parent. We apply the particle splitting to simulations
of the primordial gas cloud collapse. The thermal evolution is accurately
followed to the hydrogen number density of 10^12 /cc. With the effective mass
resolution of ~10^-4 Msun after the multi-step particle splitting, the

becoming a dressed active particle. Such a physical picture characterizes both
the lattice distortion around the moving particle and the healing of the
distorted lattice in its trajectory. We find that the dynamical behaviors of an

further observe that the defect pattern around a dressed ballistic active
particle randomly oscillates between two well-defined wing-like defect motifs

particles in this work partially deciphers the complexity of the intriguing
nonequilibrium behaviors in active crystals, and opens the promising

Hydrodynamics of the $N$-BBM process,http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00799v1,"['Anna De Masi', 'Pablo A. Ferrari', 'Errico Presutti', 'Nahuel Soprano-Loto']","  The Branching Brownian Motions (BBM) are particles performing independent
Brownian motions in $\mathbb R$ and each particle at rate 1 creates a new
particle at her current position; the newborn particle increments and
branchings are independent of the other particles. The $N$-BBM starts with $N$
particles and at each branching time, the leftmost particle is removed so that
the total number of particles is $N$ for all times. The $N$-BBM was proposed by
Maillard and belongs to a family of processes introduced by Brunet and Derrida.
We fix a density $\rho$ with a left boundary $L=\sup\{r\in\mathbb R:
\int_r^\infty \rho(x)dx=1\}>-\infty$ and let the initial particle positions be
iid continuous random variables with density $\rho$. We show that the empirical
measure associated to the particle positions at a fixed time $t$ converges to
an absolutely continuous measure with density $\psi(\cdot,t)$, as $N\to\infty$.
The limit $\psi$ is solution of a free boundary problem (FBP) when this
solution exists. The existence of solutions for finite time-intervals has been
recently proved by Lee.

packing fraction, and particle aspect ratio. For spherical particles or
cylindrical particles aligned with external magnetic field, the model can be
fitted to the measured data with agreement within 17\%. However, we find that
the random alignment of particles relative to the magnetic field plays a role,
reducing $\chi_{eff}$ by a factor of 3 in some cases, which is not accounted
for in models yet. While suspensions are predicted to have $\chi_{eff}$ that

Contact transience during slow loading of dense granular materials,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07674v1,['Matthew R. Kuhn'],"  The irregularity of particle motions during quasi-static deformation is
investigated using discrete element (DEM) simulations of sphere and

are analyzed: relative motions of particle centers, relative motions of
material points of two particles at their contact, and the traversal of
contacts across the surfaces of particles. Motions are a complex combination of
rolling, sliding, and elastic distortion at the contacts, and all motions are
highly irregular and variant, qualities that increase with increasing strain.
The relative motions of particle centers diverge greatly from those of an
affine displacement of the particles. The motions of the nonconvex
sphere-cluster particles were more regular that those of the spheres. The paper
also investigates the effect of the distance between two remote particles and
their pair-wise relative displacements. Even for particle pairs separated by

faster. Their sedimentation speed then depends linearly on the overall

order to enable multi-dimensional simulations with basic spectral radiative
transfer when the computational resources are not sufficient to solve the
complete Boltzmann transport equation. The distribution function of the
transported particles is decomposed into trapped and streaming particle
components. Their separate evolution equations are coupled by a source term
that converts trapped particles into streaming particles. We determine this
source term by requiring the correct diffusion limit. For a smooth transition
to the free streaming regime, this 'diffusion source' is limited by the matter
emissivity. The resulting streaming particle emission rates are integrated over

treatment of the streaming particle component. Different approximations may

\sim 200$ and 400. The evolution of both heavy and light particle pairs is
analysed at varying the particle Stokes number and the fluid-to-particle
density ratio. For heavy particles, it is found that turbulent dispersion is
schematically governed by two temporal regimes. The first is dominated by the
presence, at large Stokes numbers, of small-scale caustics in the particle
velocity statistics, and it lasts until heavy particle velocities have relaxed
towards the underlying flow velocities. At such large scales, a second regime
starts where heavy particles separate as tracers particles would do. As a
consequence, at increasing inertia, a larger transient stage is observed, and
the Richardson diffusion of simple tracers is recovered only at large times and
large scales. These features also arise from a statistical closure of the
equation of motion for heavy particle separation that is proposed, and which is
supported by the numerical results. In the case of light particles with high
density ratios, strong small-scale clustering leads to a considerable fraction
of pairs that do not separate at all, although the mean separation increases
with time. This effect strongly alters the shape of the probability density
function of light particle separations.

"Sound relativistic quantum mechanics for a strictly solitary
  nonzero-mass particle, and its quantum-field reverberations",http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.4025v1,['Steven Kenneth Kauffmann'],"  It is generally acknowledged that neither the Klein-Gordon equation nor the
Dirac Hamiltonian can produce sound solitary-particle relativistic quantum
mechanics due to the ill effects of their negative-energy solutions; instead
their field-quantized wavefunctions are reinterpreted as dealing with particle
and antiparticle simultaneously--despite the clear physical distinguishability
of antiparticle from particle and the empirically known slight breaking of the
underlying CP invariance. The natural square-root Hamiltonian of the free
relativistic solitary particle is iterated to obtain the Klein-Gordon equation
and linearized to obtain the Dirac Hamiltonian, steps that have calculational
but not physical motivation, and which generate the above-mentioned problematic
negative-energy solutions as extraneous artifacts. Since the natural square
root Hamiltonian for the free relativistic solitary particle contrariwise
produces physically unexceptionable quantum mechanics, this article focuses on
extending that Hamiltonian to describe a solitary particle (of either spin 0 or
spin one-half) in relativistic interaction with an external electromagnetic
field. That is achieved by use of Lorentz-covariant solitary-particle four
momentum techniques together with the assumption that well-known
nonrelativistic dynamics applies in the particle's rest frame.
Lorentz-invariant solitary particle actions, whose formal Hamiltonization is an
equivalent alternative approach, are as well explicitly displayed. It is
proposed that two separate solitary-particle wavefunctions, one for a particle
and the other for its antiparticle, be independently quantized in lieu of
""reinterpreting"" negative energy solutions--which indeed don't even afflict
proper solitary particles.

  Kinematic Edges and Cusps",http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0899v2,"['Kaustubh Agashe', 'Doojin Kim', 'Manuel Toharia', 'Devin G. E. Walker']","  We emphasize that the stabilizing symmetry for dark matter (DM) particles
does not have to be the commonly used parity (Z_2) symmetry. We therefore
examine the potential of the colliders to distinguish models with parity
stabilized DM from models in which the DM is stabilized by other symmetries. We
often take the latter to be a Z_3 symmetry for illustration. We focus on
signatures where a single particle, charged under the DM stabilization symmetry
decays into the DM and Standard Model (SM) particles. Such a Z_3-charged
""mother"" particle can decay into one or two DM particles along with the same SM
particles. This can be contrasted with the decay of a Z_2-charged mother
particle, where only one DM particle appears. Thus, if the intermediate
particles in these decay chains are off-shell, then the reconstructed invariant
mass of the SM particles exhibits two kinematic edges for the Z_3 case but only
one for the Z_2 case. For the case of on-shell intermediate particles,
distinguishing the two symmetries requires more than the kinematic edges. In
this case, we note that certain decay chain ""topologies"" of the mother particle
which are present for the Z_3 case (but absent for the Z_2 case) generate a
""cusp"" in the invariant mass distribution of the SM particles. We demonstrate
that this cusp is generally invariant of the various spin configurations. We
further apply these techniques within the context of explicit models.

a different behavior from that of randomly distributed particles -i.e. fluid

normalized by that of randomly distributed particles is used to quantify the
clustering. Light particles show maximum clustering for St around 1-2. The
results are consistent with previous investigations employing other approaches

Voronoi volumes and their Lagrangian autocorrelations. The small Voronoi
volumes of light particles correspond to regions of higher enstrophy than those

regions. The Lagrangian temporal autocorrelation function of Voronoi volumes
shows that the clustering of light particles lasts much longer than that of
heavy or neutrally buoyant particles. Due to inertial effects, the Lagrangian

that of the enstrophy of the flow itself.

expression U^{EM} is the total electromagnetic energy of the system of particle
1 and all other particles. In deriving this result we review the old but not
widely known results that Maxwell's equations follow uniquely from Special
Relativity, and that the Lorentz force law follows from applying Hamilton's
variational principle to this result.
  For a two particle system, the standard view is that the electromagnetic
force on particle 1 is the result of the charge of particle 1 interacting
locally with the field of particle 2, and conversely. Both charges 1 and 2, and

contribute to the electromagnetic interaction everywhere, over all of space.
The charges of the particles do not enter the theory except incidentally, via
Gauss's law. This has novel interpretational consequences. In particular, it
allows a charged particle to be replaced by its electric and magnetic fields,
much as a particle in quantum mechanics is replaced by its complex valued

fluid-particle flows with a two-way coupled Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
(SPH) for the fluid and the Discrete Element Method (DEM) for the solid phase.
The unresolved fluid model, based on the locally averaged Navier Stokes
equations, is expected to be considerably faster than fully resolved models.
Furthermore, in contrast to similar mesh-based Discrete Particle Methods
(DPMs), our purely particle-based method enjoys the flexibility that comes from
the lack of a prescribed mesh. It is suitable for problems such as free surface
flow or flow around complex, moving and/or intermeshed geometries and is
applicable to both dilute and dense particle flows.
  Second, a comprehensive validation procedure for fluid-particle simulations
is presented and applied here to the SPH-DEM method, using simulations of
single and multiple particle sedimentation in a 3D fluid column and comparison
with analytical models. Millimetre-sized particles are used along with three
different test fluids: air, water and a water-glycerol solution. The velocity
evolution for a single particle compares well (less than 1% error) with the
analytical solution as long as the fluid resolution is coarser than two times
the particle diameter. Two more complex multiple particle sedimentation
problems (sedimentation of a homogeneous porous block and an inhomogeneous
Rayleigh Taylor instability) are also reproduced well for porosities 0.6 <=
\epsilon <= 1.0, although care should be taken in the presence of high porosity
gradients.
  Overall the SPH-DEM method successfully reproduces quantitatively the
expected behaviour in the test cases, and promises to be a flexible and
accurate tool for other, realistic fluid-particle system simulations.

particles are depleted and the slightly smaller size of the central particle
stabilizes icosahedral order. For the latter, on the other hand, we found that
very small particles are expelled from crystals and accumulated on the growth
front of crystals. We emphasize that such information has not been accessible

A minimal model for acoustic forces on Brownian particles,http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0702v1,"['F. Balboa Usabiaga', 'R. Delgado-Buscalioni']","  We present a generalization of the inertial coupling (IC) [Usabiaga et al. J.
Comp. Phys. 2013] which permits the resolution of radiation forces on small
particles with arbitrary acoustic contrast factor. The IC method is based on a
Eulerian-Lagrangian approach: particles move in continuum space while the fluid
equations are solved in a regular mesh (here we use the finite volume method).
Thermal fluctuations in the fluid stress, important below the micron scale, are
also taken into account following the Landau-Lifshitz fluid description. Each
particle is described by a minimal cost resolution which consists on a single
small kernel (bell-shaped function) concomitant to the particle. The main role
of the particle kernel is to interpolate fluid properties and spread particle
forces. Here, we extend the kernel functionality to allow for an arbitrary
particle compressibility. The particle-fluid force is obtained from an imposed
no-slip constraint which enforces similar particle and kernel fluid velocities.
This coupling is instantaneous and permits to capture the fast, non-linear
effects underlying the radiation forces on particles. Acoustic forces arise
either because an excess in particle compressibility (monopolar term) or in
mass (dipolar contribution) over the fluid values. Comparison with theoretical
expressions show that the present generalization of the IC method correctly

Particle Filtering with Invertible Particle Flow,http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08799v5,"['Yunpeng Li', 'Mark Coates']","  A key challenge when designing particle filters in high-dimensional state
spaces is the construction of a proposal distribution that is close to the
posterior distribution. Recent advances in particle flow filters provide a
promising avenue to avoid weight degeneracy; particles drawn from the prior
distribution are migrated in the state-space to the posterior distribution by
solving partial differential equations. Numerous particle flow filters have
been proposed based on different assumptions concerning the flow dynamics.
Approximations are needed in the implementation of all of these filters; as a
result the articles do not exactly match a sample drawn from the desired
posterior distribution. Past efforts to correct the discrepancies involve
expensive calculations of importance weights. In this paper, we present new
filters which incorporate deterministic particle flows into an encompassing
particle filter framework. The valuable theoretical guarantees concerning
particle filter performance still apply, but we can exploit the attractive
performance of the particle flow methods. The filters we describe involve a
computationally efficient weight update step, arising because the embedded
particle flows we design possess an invertible mapping property. We evaluate
the proposed particle flow particle filters' performance through numerical
simulations of a challenging multi-target multi-sensor tracking scenario and
complex high-dimensional filtering examples.

"The effect of cooling on particle trajectories and acceleration in
  relativistic magnetic reconnection",http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05219v1,"['Daniel Kagan', 'Ehud Nakar', 'Tsvi Piran']","  The maximum synchrotron burnoff limit of 160 MeV represents a fundamental
limit to radiation resulting from electromagnetic particle acceleration in
one-zone ideal plasmas. In magnetic reconnection, however, particle
acceleration and radiation are decoupled because the electric field is larger
than the magnetic field in the diffusion region. We carry out two-dimensional
particle-in-cell simulations to determine the extent to which magnetic
reconnection can produce synchrotron radiation above the burnoff limit. We use
the test particle comparison (TPC) method to isolate the effects of cooling by
comparing the trajectories and acceleration efficiencies of test particles
incident on such a reconnection region with and without cooling them. We find
that the cooled and uncooled particle trajectories are typically similar during
acceleration in the reconnection region, and derive an effective limit on
particle acceleration that is inversely proportional to the average magnetic
field experienced by the particle during acceleration. Using the calculated
distribution of this average magnetic field as a function of uncooled final
particle energy, we find analytically that cooling does not affect power-law
particle energy spectra except at energies far above the synchrotron burnoff
limit. Finally, we compare fully cooled and uncooled simulations of
reconnection, confirming that the synchrotron burnoff limit does not produce a
cutoff in the particle energy spectrum. Our results indicate that the TPC
method accurately predicts the effects of cooling on particle acceleration in
relativistic reconnection, and that even far above the burnoff limit, the
synchrotron energy of radiation produced in reconnection is not limited by
cooling.

observe collisions between mm-sized particles at relative velocities of
$<$1~cm/s, and (b) to study the formation and disruption of particle clusters

resulting collisions between the particles in the sample cells were recorded by
the experiment camera.

recording a great number of collisions. The average particle velocities in the
sample cells after each shaking event were around 1 cm/s. After shaking
stopped, the inter-particle collisions damped the particle kinetic energy in
less than 20~s, reducing the average particle velocity to below 1 mm/s, and
eventually slowing them to below our detection threshold. As the particle
velocity decreased, we observed the transition from bouncing to sticking

  We focus on the variation of the heat transfer with the particle Reynolds
number, total volume fraction (number of particles) and the ratio between the
particle and fluid thermal diffusivity, quantified in terms of an effective
suspension diffusivity. We show that, when inertia at the particle scale is
negligible, the heat transfer increases with respect to the unladen case

significantly larger, saturating at higher volume fractions. By phase-ensemble
averaging we identify the different mechanisms contributing to the total heat
transfer and show that the increase of the effective conductivity observed at
finite inertia is due to the increase of the transport associated to fluid and
particle velocity. We also show that the heat conduction in the solid phase

ergodicity (for noisy signal and observation) without appealing to the large

Hyperuniformity Disorder Length Spectroscopy for Extended Particles,http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01524v2,['D. J. Durian'],"  The concept of a hyperuniformity disorder length $h$ was recently introduced
for analyzing volume fraction fluctuations for a set of measuring windows. This
length permits a direct connection to the nature of disorder in the spatial
configuration of the particles, and provides a way to diagnose the degree of
hyperuniformity in terms of the scaling of $h$ and its value in comparison with
established bounds. Here, this approach is generalized for extended particles,
which are larger than the image resolution and can lie partially inside and
partially outside the measuring windows. The starting point is an expression
for the volume fraction variance in terms of four distinct volumes: that of the
particle, the measuring window, the mean-squared overlap between particle and
region, and the region over which particles have non-zero overlap with the
measuring window. After establishing limiting behaviors, computational methods
are developed for both continuum and pixelated particles. Exact results are
presented for particles of special shape, and for measuring windows of special
shape. Comparison is made for other particle shapes, using simulated Poisson
patterns. And the effects of polydisersity and image errors are discussed. For
small measuring windows, both particle shape and spatial arrangement affect the
form of the variance. For large regions, the variance scaling depends only on
arrangement but particle shape sets the numerical proportionality. The combined
understanding permit the measured variance to be translated to the spectrum of
hyperuniformity lengths versus region size, as the quantifier of spatial
arrangement. This program is demonstrated for a system of non-overlapping
particles at a series of increasing packing fractions as well as for an
Einstein pattern of particles with several different extended shapes.

The physical domain in SDPD-DV contains external and internal solid boundaries,
periodic inlets and outlets, and the fluid region. The solid boundaries of the
domain are represented with boundary particles which have an assigned position,
wall velocity, and temperature upon initialization. The fluid domain is
discretized with fluid particles placed in a global index. The algorithm for
nearest neighbor particle search is based on a combination of the linked-cell
and Verlet-list approaches and utilizes large rectangular cells for
computational efficiency. The density model of a fluid particle in the
proximity of a solid boundary includes the contribution from the virtual
particles in its truncated support domain. The thermodynamic properties of a
virtual particle are identical to those of the corresponding fluid particle.
Additional verification involves SDPD-DV simulations of transient, planar,
Couette liquid water flow. The top plate is moving at and separated by 10-3 m
from the bottom stationary plate. The numerical results are in very good
agreement with the analytical solutions. Additional SDPD-DV verification is
accomplished with the simulation of a body-force driven, low-Reynolds number

which incorporates the use of adaptive mesh refinement features, is potentially
a key to simulate astrophysical systems on spatial scales that are beyond the

non-relativistic shocks with various Alfvenic Mach numbers and magnetic field

of the shock front and the magnetic field locally help the particles to enter

particle-laden flows may degrade when the particle and fluid momentum equations
are two-way coupled. In these cases the fluid velocity at the location of the

altered by the presence of the particle, modifying the slip velocity and
producing an erroneous prediction of coupling forces between fluid and
particle. In this article, we propose a correction scheme to eliminate this
error and predict the undisturbed fluid velocity accurately. Conceptually, in
this method, the computation cell is treated as a solid object immersed in the
fluid that is subjected to the two-way coupling force and dragged at a velocity
that is identical to the disturbance created by the particle. The proposed
scheme is generic as it can be applied to unstructured grids with arbitrary
geometry and particles that have different size and density. At its crudest
form for isotropic grids, the present correction scheme reduces to dividing the
Stokes drag by $1 - 0.75\Lambda$, where $\Lambda$ is the ratio of the particle
diameter to the grid size. The accuracy of the proposed scheme is evaluated by
comparing the computed settling velocity of individual and pair of particles
under gravity on anisotropic rectilinear grids against analytical solutions.
This comparison shows up to two orders of magnitude reduction in error in cases

Particle Ice Front Interaction - The Brownian Ratchet Model,http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.10258v1,"['Michael Chasnitsky', 'Victor Yashunsky', 'Ido Braslavsky']","  We treat the problem of particle pushing by growing ice as a free diffusion
near a wall that moves with discrete steps. When the particle diffuse away from
the surface the surface can grow, blocking the particle from going back.
Elementary calculations of the model reproduce established results for the
critical velocity $v_c$ for particle engulfment: $v_c\sim 1/r$ for large
particles and $v_c\sim$ Const for small particles, $r$ being the particle's
radius. Using our model we calculate the dragging distance of the particle by
treating the pushing as a sequence of growing steps by the surface, each
enabled by the particle's diffusion away. Eventually the particle is engulfed
by ice growing around it when a rare event of long diffusion time away from the
surface occurs. By calculating numerically the statistics of the diffusion
times from the surface and therefore the probability for a such a rare event we
calculate the total dragging time and distance $L$ of the particle by the ice
front to be $L\sim\exp[1/(vr)]$ where $v$ is the freezing velocity. This
relation for $L$ is confirmed by ours and others experiments. The distance $L$
provides a length scale for pattern formation during phase transition in
colloidal suspensions, such as ice lenses and lamellae structures by freeze
casting. Data from the literature for ice lenses thickness and lamellae spacing
during freeze casting agree with our prediction for the relation of the
distance $L$. These results lead us to conjecture that lamellae formation is

dimensionless parameter in the form of a cohesion number, which represents the
ratio of cohesive and gravitational forces acting on a particle. We test and
validate the cohesive force model for binary particle interactions in the
Drafting-Kissing-Tumbling (DKT) configuration. The DKT simulations demonstrate
that cohesive particle pairs settle in a preferred orientation, with particles
of very different sizes preferentially aligning themselves in the vertical
direction, so that the smaller particle is drafted in the wake of the larger
one. To test this mechanism in a system of higher complexity, we perform large
simulations of 1,261 polydisperse settling particles starting from rest. These
simulations reproduce several earlier experimental observations by other
authors, such as the accelerated settling of sand and silt particles due to
particle bonding. The simulations demonstrate that cohesive forces accelerate
the overall settling process primarily because smaller grains attach to larger
ones and settle in their wakes. For the present cohesion number values, we
observe that settling can be accelerated by up to 29%. We propose physically

On the drag of freely falling non-spherical particles,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08787v1,"['Gholamhossein Bagheri', 'Costanza Bonadonna']","  We present a new general model for the prediction of the drag coefficient of
non-spherical solid particles of regular and irregular shapes falling in gas or
liquid valid for sub-critical particle Reynolds numbers (i.e. $Re < 3 \times
10^5$). Results are obtained from experimental measurements on 300 regular and
irregular particles in the air and analytical solutions for ellipsoids.
Depending on their size, irregular particles are accurately characterized with
a 3D laser scanner or SEM micro-CT method. The experiments are carried out in
settling columns with height of 0.45 to 3.60m and in a 4m-high vertical wind
tunnel. In addition, $881$ additional experimental data points are also
considered that are compiled from the literature for particles of regular
shapes falling in liquids. New correlation is based on the particle Reynolds
number and two new shape descriptors defined as a function of particle
flatness, elongation and diameter. New shape descriptors are easy-to-measure
and can be more easily characterized than sphericity. The new correlation has
an average error of $\sim 10\%$, which is significantly lower than errors
associated with existing correlations. Additional aspects of particle
sedimentation is also investigated. First, it is found that particles falling
in dense liquids, in particular at $Re>1000$, tend to fall with their maximum
projection area perpendicular to their falling direction, whereas in gases
their orientation is random. Second, effects of small-scale surface
vesicularity and roughness on the drag coefficient of non-spherical particles
found to be $<10\%$. Finally, the effect of particle orientation on the drag
coefficient is discussed and additional correlations are presented to predict
the end members of drag coefficient due to change in the particle orientation.

attenuation and certain mean flow trends can be predicted by the opacity of the
particle cloud, which is a function of particle size and particle volume
fraction. We show that the Reynolds stress field plays an important role in the
momentum balance at the particle cloud edges, and therefore strongly affects
the reflected shock wave strength. The Reynolds stress was found to be
insensitive to particle size, but strongly dependent on particle volume
fraction. It is in better agreement with results from simulations of flow
through particle clouds at fixed mean slip Reynolds numbers in the
incompressible regime, than with results from other shock wave particle cloud
studies, which have utilized either inviscid or two-dimensional approaches. We
propose an algebraic model for the streamwise Reynolds stress based on the

  diagnostics",http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12646v1,"['D. Trotta', 'D. Burgess', 'G. Prete', 'S. Perri', 'G. Zimbardo']","  Recent in-situ and remote observations suggest that the transport regime
associated with shock accelerated particles may be anomalous {i.e., the Mean
Square Displacement (MSD) of such particles scales non-linearly with time}. We
use self-consistent, hybrid PIC plasma simulations to simulate a quasi-parallel
shock with parameters compatible with heliospheric shocks, and gain insights
about the particle transport in such a system. For suprathermal particles
interacting with the shock we compute the MSD separately in the upstream and
downstream regions. Tracking suprathermal particles for sufficiently long times
up and/or downstream of the shock poses problems in particle plasma
simulations, such as statistically poor particle ensembles and trajectory
fragments of variable length in time. Therefore, we introduce the use of
time-averaged mean square displacement (TAMSD), which is based on single
particle trajectories, as an additional technique to address the transport
regime for the upstream and downstream regions. MSD and TAMSD are in agreement
for the upstream energetic particle population, and both give a strong
indication of superdiffusive transport, consistent with interplanetary shock
observations. MSD and TAMSD are also in reasonable agreement downstream, where
indications of anomalous transport are also found. TAMSD shows evidence of
heterogeneity in the diffusion properties of the downstream particle
population, ranging from subdiffusive behaviour of particles trapped in the
strong magnetic field fluctuations generated at the shock, to superdiffusive
behaviour of particles transmitted and moving away from the shock.

"Inertial particles distribute in turbulence as Poissonian points with
  random intensity inducing clustering and supervoiding",http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06140v1,"['Lukas Schmidt', 'Itzhak Fouxon', 'Markus Holzner']","  This work considers the distribution of inertial particles in turbulence
using the point-particle approximation. We demonstrate that the random point
process formed by the positions of particles in space is a Poisson point
process with log-normal random intensity (""log Gaussian Cox process"" or LGCP).
The probability of having a finite number of particles in a small volume is
given in terms of the characteristic function of a log-normal distribution.
Corrections due to discreteness of the number of particles to the previously
derived statistics of particle concentration in the continuum limit are
provided. These are relevant for dealing with experimental or numerical data.
The probability of having regions without particles, i.e. voids, is larger for
inertial particles than for tracer particles where voids are distributed
according to Poisson processes. Further, the probability of having large voids
decays only log-normally with size. This shows that particles cluster, leaving
voids behind. At scales where there is no clustering there can still be an
increase of the void probability so that turbulent voiding is stronger than
clustering. The demonstrated double stochasticity of the distribution
originates in the two-step formation of fluctuations. First, turbulence brings
the particles randomly close together which happens with Poisson-type
probability. Then, turbulence compresses the particles' volume in the
observation volume. We confirm the theory of the statistics of the number of
particles in small volumes by numerical observations of inertial particle
motion in a chaotic ABC flow. The improved understanding of clustering
processes can be applied to predict the long-time survival probability of
reacting particles. Our work implies that the particle distribution in weakly
compressible flow with finite time correlations is a LGCP, independently of the
details of the flow statistics.

Dynamics and ordering of weakly Brownian particles in directional drying,http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07067v1,"['Cécile Noirjean', 'Moreno Marcellini', 'Tom Kodger', 'Cécile Monteux', 'Sylvain Deville']","  Drying of particle suspensions is an ubiquitous phenomenon with many natural
and practical applications. In particular, in unidirectional drying, the
evaporation of the solvent induces flows which accumulate particles at the
liquid/air interface. The progressive build-up of a dense region of particles
can be used, in particular, in the processing of advanced materials and
architectures while the development of heterogeneities and defects in such
systems is critical to their function. A lot of attention has thus been paid to
correlate the flow and particles dynamics to the ordering of particles.
However, dynamic observation at the particle scale and its correlation with
local particle ordering are still missing. Here we show by measuring the
particle velocities with high frame rate laser scanning confocal microscopy
that the ordering of weakly Brownian particles during directional drying in a
Hele-Shaw cell opened on one side depends on the particle velocity. Under the
ambient and experimental conditions presented in the following, the particle
velocities accumulate in two branches. A higher degree of ordering is found for
the branch of faster particle velocity which we explain by an increase in the
pressure drop which drags the particles into a denser packing as the flow
velocity increases. This counter-intuitive behaviour is the opposite to what is
found with Brownian particles, which can reorganize by Brownian motion into
denser packing during drying, as long as the flow velocity is not too high.
These results show that different kinetic conditions can be used to obtain
dense, defect-free regions of particles after drying. In particular, it
suggests that rapid, directional drying could be used to control the
crystallinity of particle deposits.

A construction of infinite Brownian particle systems,http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06211v1,['Mykhaylo Shkolnikov'],"  The paper identifies families of quasi-stationary initial conditions for
infinite Brownian particle systems within a large class and provides a
construction of the particle systems themselves started from such initial
conditions. Examples of particle systems falling into our framework include
Brownian versions of TASEP-like processes such as the diffusive scaling limit
of the q-TASEP process. In this context the spacings between consecutive
particles form infinite-dimensional versions of the softly reflected Brownian
motions recently introduced in the finite-dimensional setting by O'Connell and
Ortmann and are of independent interest. The proof of the main result is based
on intertwining relations satisfied by the particle systems involved which can
be regarded as infinite-dimensional analogues of the suitably generalized
Burke's Theorem.

narrower in the case of frictional particles than frictionless particles,
implying that correlations of overlaps are strongly reduced by microscopic

Shadowing-based reliability decay in softened n-body simulations,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0211128v1,['Wayne Hayes'],"  A shadow of a numerical solution to a chaotic system is an_exact_ solution to
the equations of motion that remains close to the numerical solution for a long
time. In a collisionless n-body system, we know that particle motion is
governed by the global potential rather than by inter-particle interactions. As
a result, the trajectory of each individual particle in the system is
independently shadowable. It is thus meaningful to measure the number of
particles that have shadowable trajectories as a function of time. We find that
the number of shadowable particles decays exponentially with time as exp(-mu
t), and that for eps in [~0.2,1] (in units of the local mean inter-particle
separation $\bar n$), there is an explicit relationship between the decay
constant mu, the timestep h of the leapfrog integrator, the softening eps, and
the number of particles N in the simulation. Thus, given N and eps, it is
possible to pre-compute the timestep h necessary to acheive a desired fraction
of shadowable particles after a given length of simulation time. We demonstrate
that a large fraction of particles remain shadowable over ~100 crossing times
even if particles travel up to about 1/3 of the softening length per timestep.
However, a sharp decrease in the number of shadowable particles occurs if the
timestep increases to allow particles to travel further than 1/3 the softening
length in one timestep, or if the softening is decreased below ~0.2$\bar n$.

Microscopic Motion of Particles Flowing through a Porous Medium,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9903277v1,"['Jysoo Lee', 'Joel Koplik']","  We use Stokesian Dynamics simulations to study the microscopic motion of
particles suspended in fluids passing through porous media. We construct model
porous media with fixed spherical particles, and allow mobile ones to move
through this fixed bed under the action of an ambient velocity field. We first
consider the pore scale motion of individual suspended particles at pore
junctions. The relative particle flux into different possible directions
exiting from a single pore, for two and three dimensional model porous media is
found to approximately equal the corresponding fractional channel width or
area. Next we consider the waiting time distribution for particles which are
delayed in a junction, due to a stagnation point caused by a flow bifurcation.
The waiting times are found to be controlled by two-particle interactions, and
the distributions take the same form in model porous media as in two-particle
systems. A simple theoretical estimate of the waiting time is consistent with
the simulations. We also find that perturbing such a slow-moving particle by
another nearby one leads to rather complicated behavior. We study the stability
of geometrically trapped particles. For simple model traps, we find that
particles passing nearby can ``relaunch'' the trapped particle through its
hydrodynamic interaction, although the conditions for relaunching depend
sensitively on the details of the trap and its surroundings.

An interaction Lagrangian for two spin 1/2 elementary Dirac particles,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0702172v1,['Martin Rivas'],"  The kinematical formalism for describing spinning particles developped by the
author is based upon the idea that an elementary particle is a physical system
with no excited states. It can be annihilated by the interaction with its
antiparticle but, if not destroyed, its internal structure can never be
modified. All possible states of the particle are just kinematical
modifications of any one of them. The kinematical state space of the
variational formalism of an elementary particle is necessarily a homogeneous
space of the kinematical group of spacetime symmetries. By assuming Poincare
invariance we have already described a model of a classical spinning particle
which satisfies Dirac's equation when quantized. We have recently shown that
the spacetime symmetry group of this Dirac particle is larger than the Poincare
group. It also contains spacetime dilations and local rotations. In this work
we obtain an interaction Lagrangian for two Dirac particles, which is invariant
under this enlarged spacetime group. It describes a short- and long-range
interaction such that when averaged, to supress the spin content of the
particles, describes the instantaneous Coulomb interaction between them. As an
application, we analyse the interaction between two spinning particles, and
show that it is possible the existence of metastable bound states for two
particles of the same charge, when the spins are parallel and provided some
initial conditions are fulfilled. The possibility of formation of bound pairs
is due to the zitterbewegung spin structure of the particles because when the
spin is neglected, the bound states vanish.

"What is the physical meaning of mass in view of wave-particle duality? A
  proposed model",http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0404044v2,['Donald C. Chang'],"  Mass is an important concept in classical mechanics, which regards a particle
as a corpuscular object. But according to wave-particle duality, we know a free
particle can behave like a wave. Is there a wave property that corresponds to
the mass of a particle? This is an interesting question that has not been
extensively explored before. We suggest that this problem can be approached by
treating the mass on the same footing as energy and momentum. Here we propose
that, all particles are excitation waves of the vacuum and different particles
are represented by different excitation modes. Based on such a model, we found
that mass is not an intrinsic property of the particle. Instead, mass is
basically a measure of the particle energy. The relations between energy and
mass can be directly derived based on the wave properties of the particle. This
work explains why some particles are ""wave-like"" while others are
""particle-like"". Furthermore, this work has several interesting implications.
It directly explains why photons can interact with a gravitational field. It
also suggests a possible origin of dark matter; they are thought to be composed
of excitation waves that fail to interact with each other. From this model, one
can easily see why our universe has more dark matters than visible matters.

particles. During a branching step, each particle is replaced by two new
particles, whose positions are shifted from that of the original particle by
independently performing two random walk steps according to the distribution $p
\delta_{1} + (1-p) \delta_{0}$, from the location of the original particle.
During the selection step that follows, only the N rightmost particles are kept
among the 2N particles obtained at the branching step, to form a new population
of $N$ particles. After a large number of iterated branching-selection steps,
the displacement of the whole population of $N$ particles is ballistic, with
deterministic asymptotic speed $v_{N}(p)$. As $N$ goes to infinity, $v_{N}(p)$
converges to a finite limit $v_{\infty}(p)$. The main result is that, for every

$v_{\infty}(p)- v_{N}(p)$ is $\log(N)^{-2}$. This is called Brunet-Derrida

Random deposition of particles of different sizes,http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.3541v1,"['F. L. Forgerini', 'W. Figueiredo']","  We study the surface growth generated by the random deposition of particles
of different sizes. A model is proposed where the particles are aggregated on
an initially flat surface, giving rise to a rough interface and a porous bulk.
By using Monte Carlo simulations, a surface has grown by adding particles of
different sizes, as well as identical particles on the substrate in (1 + 1)
dimensions. In the case of deposition of particles of different sizes, they are
selected from a Poisson distribution, where the particle's sizes may vary by
one order of magnitude. For the deposition of identical particles, only
particles which are larger than one lattice parameter of the substrate are
considered. We calculate the usual scaling exponents: the roughness, growth and
dynamic exponents $\alpha, \, \beta \,$ and $z$, respectively, as well as, the
porosity in the bulk, determining the porosity as a function of the particle
size. The results of our simulations show that the roughness evolves in time
following three different behaviors. The roughness in the initial times behaves
as in the random deposition model. At intermediate times, the surface roughness
grows slowly and finally, at long times, it enters into the saturation regime.
The bulk formed by depositing large particles reveals a porosity that increases
very fast at the initial times, and also reaches a saturation value. Excepting
the case where particles have the size of one lattice spacing, we always find

Dust trapping in inviscid vortex pairs,http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.3842v1,['Jean-Regis Angilella'],"  The motion of tiny heavy particles transported in a co-rotating vortex pair,
with or without particle inertia and sedimentation, is investigated. The
dynamics of non-inertial sedimenting particles is shown to be chaotic, under
the combined effect of gravity and of the circular displacement of the
vortices. This phenomenon is very sensitive to particle inertia, if any. By
using nearly hamiltonian dynamical system theory for the particle motion
equation written in the rotating reference frame, one can show that small
inertia terms of the particle motion equation strongly modify the Melnikov
function of the homoclinic trajectories and heteroclinic cycles of the
unperturbed system, as soon as the particle response time is of the order of
the settling time (Froude number of order unity). The critical Froude number
above which chaotic motion vanishes and a regular centrifugation takes place is
obtained from this Melnikov analysis and compared to numerical simulations.
Particles with a finite inertia, and in the absence of gravity, are not
necessarily centrifugated away from the vortex system. Indeed, these particles
can have various equilibrium positions in the rotating reference frame, like
the Lagrange points of celestial mechanics, according to whether their Stokes
number is smaller or larger than some critical value. An analytical stability
analysis reveals that two of these points are stable attracting points, so that
permanent trapping can occur for inertial particles injected in an isolated
co-rotating vortex pair. Particle trapping is observed to persist when
viscosity, and therefore vortex coalescence, is taken into account. Numerical
experiments at large but finite Reynolds number show that particles can indeed
be trapped temporarily during vortex roll-up, and are eventually centrifugated
away once vortex coalescence occurs.

"Dynamics of Solids in the Midplane of Protoplanetary Disks: Implications
  for Planetesimal Formation",http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.4982v2,"['Xue-Ning Bai', 'James M. Stone']","  (Abridged) We present local 2D and 3D hybrid numerical simulations of
particles and gas in the midplane of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) using the
Athena code. The particles are coupled to gas aerodynamically, with
particle-to-gas feedback included. Magnetorotational turbulence is ignored as
an approximation for the dead zone of PPDs, and we ignore particle self-gravity
to study the precursor of planetesimal formation. Our simulations include a
wide size distribution of particles, ranging from strongly coupled particles
with dimensionless stopping time tau_s=Omega t_stop=1e-4 to marginally coupled
ones with tau_s=1 (where Omega is the orbital frequency, t_stop is the particle
friction time), and a wide range of solid abundances. Our main results are: 1.
Particles with tau_s>=0.01 actively participate in the streaming instability,
generate turbulence and maintain the height of the particle layer before
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is triggered. 2. Strong particle clumping as a
consequence of the streaming instability occurs when a substantial fraction of
the solids are large (tau_s>=0.01) and when height-integrated solid to gas mass
ratio Z is super-solar. 3. The radial drift velocity is reduced relative to the
conventional Nakagawa-Sekiya-Hayashi (NSH) model, especially at high Z. We
derive a generalized NSH equilibrium solution for multiple particle species
which fits our results very well. 4. Collision velocity between particles with
tau_s>=0.01 is dominated by differential radial drift, and is strongly reduced
at larger Z. 5. There exist two positive feedback loops with respect to the
enrichment of local disk solid abundance and grain growth. All these effects
promote planetesimal formation.

Taxonomy of particles in Ising spin chains,http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0693v2,"['Dan Liu', 'Ping Lu', 'Gerhard Muller', 'Michael Karbach']","  The statistical mechanics of particles with shapes on a one-dimensional
lattice is investigated in the context of the $s=1$ Ising chain with uniform
nearest-neighbor coupling, quadratic single-site potential, and magnetic field,
which supports four distinct ground states:
$|\uparrow\downarrow\uparrow\downarrow...>$, $|\circ\circ...>$,
$|\uparrow\uparrow...>$, $|\uparrow\circ\uparrow\circ...>$. The complete
spectrum is generated from each ground state by particles from a different set
of six or seven species. Particles and elements of pseudo-vacuum are
characterized by motifs (patterns of several consecutive site variables).
Particles are floating objects that can be placed into open slots on the
lattice. Open slots are recognized as permissible links between motifs. The
energy of a particle varies between species but is independent of where it is
placed. Placement of one particle changes the open-slot configuration for
particles of all species. This statistical interaction is encoded in a
generalized Pauli principle, from which the multiplicity of states for a given
particle combination is determined and used for the exact statistical
mechanical analysis. Particles from all species belong to one of four
categories: compacts, hosts, tags, or hybrids. Compacts and hosts find open
slots in segments of pseudo-vacuum. Tags find open slots inside hosts. Hybrids
are tags with hosting capability. In the taxonomy of particles proposed here,
`species' is indicative of structure and `category' indicative of function. The
hosting function splits the Pauli principle into exclusion and accommodation
parts. Near phase boundaries, the state of the Ising chain at low temperature
is akin to that of miscible or immiscible liquids with particles from one
species acting as surfactant molecules.

Collective motion of binary self-propelled particle mixtures,http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.0792v1,['Andreas M. Menzel'],"  In this study, we investigate the phenomenon of collective motion in binary
mixtures of self-propelled particles. We consider two particle species, each of
which consisting of pointlike objects that propel with a velocity of constant
magnitude. Within each species, the particles try to achieve polar alignment of
their velocity vectors, whereas we analyze the cases of preferred polar,
antiparallel, as well as perpendicular alignment between particles of different
species. Our focus is on the effect that the interplay between the two species
has on the threshold densities for the onset of collective motion and on the
nature of the solutions above onset. For this purpose, we start from suitable
Langevin equations in the particle picture, from which we derive mean field
equations of the Fokker-Planck type and finally macroscopic continuum field
equations. We perform particle simulations of the Langevin equations, linear
stability analyses of the Fokker-Planck and macroscopic continuum equations,
and we numerically solve the Fokker-Planck equations. Both, spatially
homogeneous and inhomogeneous solutions are investigated, where the latter
correspond to stripe-like flocks of collectively moving particles. In general,
the interaction between the two species reduces the threshold density for the
onset of collective motion of each species. However, this interaction also
reduces the spatial organization in the stripe-like flocks. The most
interesting behavior is found for the case of preferred perpendicular alignment
between different species. There, a competition between polar and truly nematic
orientational ordering of the velocity vectors takes place within each particle
species. Finally, depending on the alignment rule for particles of different
species and within certain ranges of particle densities, identical and inverted
spatial density profiles can be found for the two particle species.

Survival of interacting Brownian particles in crowded 1D environment,http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0778v1,"['Artem Ryabov', 'Petr Chvosta']","  We investigate a diffusive motion of a system of interacting Brownian
particles in quasi-one-dimensional micropores. In particular, we consider a
semi-infinite 1D geometry with a partially absorbing boundary and the hard-core
inter-particle interaction. Due to the absorbing boundary the number of
particles in the pore gradually decreases. We present the exact analytical
solution of the problem. Our procedure merely requires the knowledge of the
corresponding single-particle problem. First, we calculate the simultaneous
probability density of having still a definite number $N-k$ of surviving
particles at definite coordinates. Focusing on an arbitrary tagged particle, we
derive the exact probability density of its coordinate. Secondly, we present a
complete probabilistic description of the emerging escape process. The survival
probabilities for the individual particles are calculated, the first and the
second moments of the exit times are discussed. Generally speaking, although
the original inter-particle interaction possesses a point-like character, it
induces entropic repulsive forces which, e.g., push the leftmost (rightmost)
particle towards (opposite) the absorbing boundary thereby accelerating
(decelerating) its escape. More importantly, as compared to the reference
problem for the non-interacting particles, the interaction changes the
dynamical exponents which characterize the long-time asymptotic dynamics.
Interesting new insights emerge after we interpret our model in terms of a)
diffusion of a single particle in a $N$-dimensional space, and b) order
statistics defined on a system of $N$ independent, identically distributed

the collision of two massive particles with optimized mass ratio. Moreover, we
analyze perfectly elastic collision, Compton scattering, and pair annihilation

efficiency can reach 137.2%. On the other hand, our result is qualitatively
consistent with the earlier claim that the mass and energy of the emitted

orientational order. In the steady state the time and ensemble averaged
direction of the main axis of the particles encloses a small angle with the

rate, and it decreases with increasing grain aspect ratio. At the grain level
the steady state is characterized by a net rotation of the particles, as
dictated by the shear flow. The distribution of particle rotational velocities

speeds and aligning torque, we observe sedimentation with increased
sedimentation length compared with passive colloids but also active colloids
without bottom-heaviness. Increasing, for example, swimming speed the
sedimentation profile is inverted and the particles swim towards the top wall
of the enclosing box. We find maximal orientational order at intermediate

formed by the particles moving downward becomes more compact due to the
particle interaction strengthened by the downward acceleration from the
gravity. The part of a band formed by the particles moving upward is always
loosening up due to the slow down of the particle motion by the counter effect
of the gravity. To form a compact circular band (not a loosely one), enough
particles are needed to interact among themselves continuously through the
entire circular band at a rotating rate so that the upward diffusion of
particles can be balanced by the compactness process when these particles

sampling/resampling (ASIR) algorithm, which aims at reducing the cost of
traditional particle filters by approximating the likelihood with a mixture of
uniform distributions over pre-defined cells or bins. The particles in each bin

size affects tracking accuracy and runtime. Further, we show numerically that
the ASIR approximation error converges to that of sequential importance
sampling/resampling (SIR) as the bin size is decreased. We present a set of

transport properties in finite and semi-infinite one-dimensional chains. A set
of particles freely hop between nearest-neighbor sites, with the additional
condition that, when two particles meet, they merge instantaneously into one
particle. A localized source of particle-current is imposed at the origin as
well as a non-symmetric hopping rate between the left and right directions
(particle drift). This model was previously studied with exact results for the

probability of finding an empty interval between two given sites is considered.
However a different method is developed here to treat the boundary conditions
by imposing the continuity and differentiability of the interval probability,
which allows for a closed and unique solution, especially for any given initial

Fe-based superconductors has played a prominent role in the quest for
determining the symmetry of the order parameter in these compounds. Most
theoretical studies of the resonance employ an RPA-type approach in the
particle-hole channel and associate the resonance in the spin susceptibility
$\chi_S (\mathbf{q}, \omega)$ at momentum ${\bf Q} = (\pi,\pi)$ with the
spin-exciton of an $s^{+-}$ superconductor, pulled below $2\Delta$ by residual
attraction associated with the sign change of the gap between Fermi points

particle-particle channel on the spin resonance. Particle-particle and
particle-hole channels are coupled in a superconductor and to what extent the
spin resonance can be viewed as a particle-hole exciton needs to be addressed.
In the case of purely repulsive interactions we find that the particle-particle
channel at total momentum ${\bf Q}$ (the $\pi $channel) contributes little to
the resonance. However, if the interband density-density interaction is
attractive and the $\pi-$resonance is possible on its own, along with the
spin-exciton, we find a much stronger shift of the resonance frequency from the

inference of a model which involves an unobserved stochastic process, the
standard implementation uses the particle filter to propose new values for the
stochastic process, and MCMC moves to propose new values for the parameters. We
show how particle MCMC can be generalised beyond this. Our key idea is to
introduce new latent variables. We then use the MCMC moves to update the latent
variables, and the particle filter to propose new values for the parameters and
stochastic process given the latent variables. A generic way of defining these
latent variables is to model them as pseudo-observations of the parameters or
of the stochastic process. By choosing the amount of information these latent
variables have about the parameters and the stochastic process we can often
improve the mixing of the particle MCMC algorithm by trading off the Monte
Carlo error of the particle filter and the mixing of the MCMC moves. We show
that using pseudo-observations within particle MCMC can improve its efficiency
in certain scenarios: dealing with initialisation problems of the particle
filter; speeding up the mixing of particle Gibbs when there is strong
dependence between the parameters and the stochastic process; and enabling
further MCMC steps to be used within the particle filter.

adaptive Cartesian grids at hands of a particle-in-cell code. One holds the
particles within the grid cells, the other within the grid vertices. The
fundamental challenge for the algorithmic strategies results from the fact that
particles may run through the grid without velocity constraints. To facilitate
this, we rely on multiscale grid representations. They allow us to lift and
drop particles between different spatial resolutions. We call this cell-based
strategy particle in tree (PIT). Our second approach assigns particles to
vertices describing a dual grid (PIDT) and augments the lifts and drops with
multiscale linked cells.
  Our experiments validate the two schemes at hands of an electrostatic
particle-in-cell code by retrieving the dispersion relation of Langmuir waves
in a thermal plasma. They reveal that different particle and grid
characteristics favour different realisations. The possibility that particles
can tunnel through an arbitrary number of grid cells implies that most data is
exchanged between neighbouring ranks, while very few data is transferred
non-locally. This constraints the scalability as the code potentially has to
realise global communication. We show that the merger of an analysed tree
grammar with PIDT allows us to predict particle movements among several levels
and to skip parts of this global communication a priori. It is capable to
outperform several established implementations based upon trees and/or

applicable to particle-laden fluid flows where two-way momentum coupling is
important. In the point-particle formulation, particle dynamics are coupled to
fluid dynamics via a source term that appears in the respective momentum
equations. When the particle Reynolds number is small and the particle diameter
is smaller than the fluid scales, it is common to approximate the momentum
coupling source term as the Stokes drag. The Stokes drag force depends on the
difference between the undisturbed fluid velocity evaluated at the particle
location, and the particle velocity. However, owing to two-way coupling, the
fluid velocity is modified in the neighborhood of a particle, relative to its
undisturbed value. This causes the computed Stokes drag force to be
underestimated in two-way coupled point-particle simulations. We develop
estimates for the drag force error as function of the particle size relative to
the grid size. We then develop a correction method that estimates the
undisturbed fluid velocity from the computed disturbed velocity field. The
correction scheme is tested for a particle settling in an otherwise quiescent
fluid and is found to reduce the error in computed settling velocity by an
order of magnitude compared with common interpolation schemes.

particles in turbulence, provided that the effects induced by the inertial
preferential sampling of heavy/light particles outside/inside vortices are
negligible. In particular, the scheme predicts the correct functional behaviour
of the acceleration variance, as a function of Stokes, as well as the presence
of a minimum/maximum for the flatness of the acceleration of heavy/light
particles, in good qualitative agreement with numerical data. We also show that
the closure works well when applied to the Lagrangian evolution of particles
using a stochastic surrogate for the underlying Eulerian velocity field. Our
results support the conclusion that there exist important contributions to the
statistics of the acceleration of inertial particles independent of the
preferential sampling. For heavy particles we observe deviations between the
predictions of the closure scheme and direct numerical simulations, at Stokes
numbers of order unity. For light particles the deviation occurs for larger
Stokes numbers.

Phase separation in binary mixtures of active and passive particles,http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02968v3,"['Pritha Dolai', 'Aditi Simha', 'Shradha Mishra']","  We study binary mixtures of small active and big passive athermal particles
interacting via soft repulsive forces on a frictional substrate. Athermal self
propelled particles are known to phase separate into a dense aggregate and a
dilute gas-like phase at fairly low packing fractions. Known as {\emph
{motility induced phase separation}}, this phenomenon governs the behaviour of
binary mixtures for small to intermediate size ratios of the particle species.
An effective attraction between passive particles, due to the surrounding
active medium, leads to true phase separation for large size ratios and volume
fractions of active particles. The effective interaction between active and
passive particles can be attractive or repulsive at short range depending on
the size ratio and volume fractions of the particles. This affects the
clustering of passive particles. We find three distinct phases based on the
spatial distribution of passive particles.
  The cluster size distribution of passive particles decays exponentially in
the {\emph{homogeneous phase}}. It decays as a power law with an exponential
cutoff in the {\emph{clustered phase}} and tends to a power law as the system
approaches the transition to the {\emph{phase separated state}}. We present a
phase diagram in the plane defined by the size ratio and volume fraction of
passive particles.

either finite or countable, are studied. We introduce new formal mathematical
object called regular continuum system of point particles (with continuum
number of particles). Initially, each particle is characterized by the pair:
(initial coordinate, initial velocity) in $R^{2d}$. Moreover, all initial
coordinates are different and fill up some domain in $R^{d}$. Each particle
moves via normal Newtonian dynamics under influence of some external force, but
there is no interaction between particles. If the external force is bounded
then trajectories of any two particles in the phase space do not intersect.
More exactly, at any time moment any two particles have either different
coordinates or different velocities. The system is called regular if there are
no particle collisions in the coordinate space.
  The regularity condition is necessary for the velocity of the particle,
situated at a given time at a given space point, were uniquely defined. Then
the classical Euler equation for the field of velocities has rigorous meaning.
Though the continuum of particles is in fact a continuum medium, the crucial
notion of regularity was not studied in mathematical literature.
  It appeared that the seeming simplicity of the object (absence of
interaction) is delusive. Even for simple external forces we could not find
simple necessary and sufficient regularity conditions. However, we found a rich
list of examples, one-dimensional and mufti-dimensional, where we could get
regularity conditions on different time intervals. In conclusion we formulate
many unsolved problems for regular systems with interaction.

"Energetic particle transport across the mean magnetic field: before
  diffusion",http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05347v1,"['T. Laitinen', 'S. Dalla']","  Current particle transport models describe the propagation of charged
particles across the mean field direction in turbulent plasmas as diffusion.
However, recent studies suggest that at short time-scales, such as soon after
solar energetic particle (SEP) injection, particles remain on turbulently
meandering field lines, which results in non-diffusive initial propagation
across the mean magnetic field. In this work, we use a new technique to
investigate how the particles are displaced from their original field lines,
and quantify the parameters of the transition from field-aligned particle
propagation along meandering field lines to particle diffusion across the mean
magnetic field. We show that the initial decoupling of the particles from the
field lines is slow, and particles remain within a Larmor radius from their
initial meandering field lines for tens to hundreds of Larmor periods, for
0.1-10 MeV protons in turbulence conditions typical of the solar wind at 1~AU.
Subsequently, particles decouple from their initial field lines and after
hundreds to thousands of Larmor periods reach time-asymptotic diffusive
behaviour consistent with particle diffusion across the mean field caused by
the meandering of the field lines. We show that the typical duration of the
pre-diffusive phase, hours to tens of hours for 10 MeV protons in 1~AU solar
wind turbulence conditions, is significant for SEP propagation to 1~AU and must
be taken into account when modelling SEP propagation in the interplanetary
space.

numerical simulations. We fix the bulk Reynolds number and total solid volume
fraction, $Re_b = 5600$ and $\Phi=20\%$, and vary the relative fraction of
small and large particles. The binary mixture consists of particles of two
different sizes, $2h/d_l=20$ and $2h/d_s=30$ where $h$ is the half channel

the particulate flow statistics exhibit a significant alteration of the mean
velocity profile and turbulent fluctuations with respect to the unladen flow,
the differences between the mono-disperse and bi-disperse cases are small.
However, we observe a clear segregation of small particles at the wall in
binary mixtures, which affects the dynamics of the near wall region and thus
the overall drag. This results in a higher drag in suspensions with a larger
amount of large particles. As regards bi-disperse effects on the particle
dynamics, a non-monotonic variation of the particle dispersion in the spanwise
(homogeneous) direction is observed when increasing the percentage of

cluster more at contact whereas the dynamics of the large particles gives
highest collision kernels due to a higher approaching speed.

into the hot downstream thermal plasma with a substantial fraction of energy
going into a broad spectrum of superthermal charged particles and magnetic
fluctuations. The superthermal particles can penetrate into the shock upstream
region producing an extended shock precursor. The cold upstream plasma flow is
decelerated by the force provided by the superthermal particle pressure
gradient. In high Mach number collisionless shocks, efficient particle
acceleration is likely coupled with turbulent magnetic field amplification
(MFA) generated by the anisotropic distribution of accelerated particles. This
anisotropy is determined by the fast particle transport making the problem
strongly nonlinear and multi-scale. Here, we present a nonlinear Monte Carlo
model of collisionless shock structure with super-diffusive propagation of
high-energy Fermi accelerated particles coupled to particle acceleration and
MFA which affords a consistent description of strong shocks. A distinctive
feature of the Monte Carlo technique is that it includes the full angular
anisotropy of the particle distribution at all precursor positions. The model
reveals that the super-diffusive transport of energetic particles (i.e.,
Levy-walk propagation) generates a strong quadruple anisotropy in the precursor
particle distribution. The resultant pressure anisotropy of the high-energy

compressible wave modes with wavelengths longer than the gyroradii of the

different Gaussian distributions of particle radii are considered (i.e. 3
different standard deviations). The distributions are centered on the reference

radius of the largest particles is 4 times that of the smaller particles. We

and particle velocity profiles are almost perfectly overlapping. Slightly
larger differences are found for particle velocity fluctuations. These increase
close to the wall and decrease towards the centerline as the standard deviation

the bulk Reynolds number $Re_b$ is the key parameter in inertial migration of
particles in dilute suspensions. At low solid volume fraction ($\phi=0.4\%$)
and low bulk Reynolds number $(Re_b= 144)$, particles accumulate at the center
of the duct walls. As $Re_b$ is increased, the focusing position moves
progressively towards the corners of the duct. At higher volume fractions,
$\phi=5, 10$ and $20\%$, and in wider ducts with $Re_b=550$, particles are
found to migrate away from the duct core towards the walls. In particular, for
$\phi=5$ and $10\%$, particles accumulate preferentially at the corners. At the
highest volume fraction considered, $\phi=20\%$, particles sample all the
volume of the duct, with a lower concentration at the duct core. The presence
of particles induces secondary cross-stream motions in the duct cross-section,

particle rotation rate, on the maximum concentration of particles in focusing

the previous study of the present authors, by estimating the fluid force
correlated with the disturbed flow. We validate the model against
interface-resolved simulations using the immersed-boundary method. Simulations
of single particles show that the history effect is well captured by the
present estimation method based on the disturbed flow. Similarly, the
simulation of the flow around a rotating particle demonstrates that the lift
force is also well captured by the proposed method. We also consider the
interaction between non-negligible size particles and an array of Taylor-Green
vortices. For density ratios $\rho_d/\rho_c\geq$ 10, the results show that the
particle motion captured by the VA approach is closer to that of the
fully-resolved simulations than that obtained with a traditional two-way
coupling simulation. The flow disturbance is also well represented by the VA
simulation. In particular, it is found that history effects enhance the
curvature of the trajectory in vortices and this enhancement increases with the
particle size. Furthermore, the flow field generated by a neighboring particle
at distances of around ten particle diameters significantly influences particle
trajectories. The computational cost of the VA simulation proposed here is

massive spinning particles in $d=3,4$, the world sheets are shown to be
cylinders. The radius of cylinder is fixed by representation. In higher

particle path is defined by a single fourth-order differential equation having
two zero-order gauge symmetries. The equation defines particle's path in

$R^\mathrm{P} / R^\mathrm{S} \gg 1$, approximately equivalent to the swimmer
interacting with a fixed, flat surface. We find that details of the swimmer and
particle trajectories vary for different swimmers. However, the overall
characteristics of the scattering event fall into two regimes, depending on the
relative magnitudes of the impact parameter, $\rho$, and the collision radius,
$R^\mathrm{coll}=R^\mathrm{P} + R^\mathrm{S}$. The range of particle motion,
defined as the maximum distance between two points on the trajectory, has only
a weak dependence on the impact parameter when $\rho < R^\mathrm{coll}$ and
decreases with the radius of the particle. In contrast, when
$\rho>R^\mathrm{coll}$ the range decreases as a power law in $\rho$ and is
insensitive to the size of the particle. We also demonstrate that large
particles can cause swimmers to be deflected through large angles. In some
instances, this swimmer deflection can lead to larger net displacements of the
particle. Based on these results, we estimate the effective diffusivity of a

behaviors with increasing particle inertia, similar to the results from the
linear stability analysis of saffman, 1962: low-inertia particles trigger the
laminar-to-turbulent instability whereas high-inertia particles tend to
stabilize turbulence due to the extra dissipation induced by particle-fluid
coupling. Furthermore, it is found that the streamwise coupling between phases
is the dominant factor in damping the turbulence and is highly related to the
spatial distribution of the particles. The presence of particles in different
turbulent coherent structures (large scale vortices or large scale streaks)
determines the turbulent kinetic energy of particulate phase, which is related
to the particle response time scaled by the turnover time of large scale
vortices. By quantitatively investigating the periodic character of the whole
regeneration cycle and the phase difference between linked sub-steps, we show
that the presence of inertial particles does not alter the periodic nature of
the cycle or the relative length of each of the sub-steps. Instead,
high-inertia particles greatly weaken the large-scale vortices as well as the
streamwise vorticity stretching and lift-up effects, thereby suppressing the
fluctuating amplitude of the large scale streaks. The primary influence of
low-inertia particles, however, is to strengthen the large scale vortices,
which fosters the cycle and ultimately reduces the critical Reynolds number.

Reynolds number based on the Taylor microscale ranges from $Re_{\lambda}\approx

most intense for $St_{\eta} \approx 1$, but it extends over larger scales for
heavier particles. Individual clusters form a hierarchy of self-similar,
fractal-like objects, preferentially aligned with gravity and sizes that can
reach the integral scale of the turbulence. Remarkably, the settling velocity

still-air terminal velocity, and the clusters can fall even faster. This is
caused by downward fluid fluctuations preferentially sweeping the particles,

"How do trapped particles interact with and sample superfluid vortex
  excitations?",http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01111v1,"['Umberto Giuriato', 'Giorgio Krstulovic', 'Sergey Nazarenko']","  Particles have been used for more than a decade to visualize and study the
dynamics of quantum vortices in superfluid helium. In this work we study how
the dynamics of a collection of particles set inside a vortex reflects the
motion of the vortex. We use a minimal self-consistent model based on the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation coupled with classical particle dynamics. We find
that each particle oscillates with a natural frequency proportional to the
number of vortices attached to it. We then study the dynamics of an array of
particles trapped in a quantum vortex and use particle trajectories to measure
the frequency spectrum of the vortex excitations. Surprisingly, due to the
discreetness of the array, the vortex excitations measured by the particles
exhibits bands, gaps and Brillouin zones, analogous to the ones of electrons
moving in crystals. We then establish a mathematical analogy, where vortex
excitations play the role of electrons and particles that of the potential
barriers constituting the crystal. We find that the height of the effective
potential barriers is proportional to the particle mass and the frequency of
the incoming waves. We conclude that large-scale vortex excitations could be in
principle directly measured by particles and novel physics could emerge from
particle-vortex interaction.

  number and lift force",http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02270v1,"['Jean-Paul Mollicone', 'Mahshid Sharifi', 'Francesco Battista', 'Paolo Gualtieri', 'Carlo Massimo Casciola']","  Particle-laden turbulent flow that separates due to a bump inside a channel
is simulated to analyse the effects of the Stokes number and the lift force on
the particle spatial distribution. The fluid friction Reynolds number is
approximately 900 over the bump, the highest achieved for similar computational
domains. A range of particle Stokes numbers are considered, each simulated with
and without the lift force in the particle dynamic equation. When the lift
force is included a significant difference in the particle concentration, in
the order of thousands, is observed in comparison with cases where the lift
force is omitted. The greatest deviation is in regions of high vorticity,
particularly at the walls and in the shear layer but results show that the
concentration also changes in the bulk of the flow away from the walls. The
particle behaviour changes drastically when the Stokes number is varied. As the
Stokes number increases, particles bypass the recirculating region that is
formed after the bump and their redistribution is mostly affected by the strong
shear layer. Particles segregate at the walls and particularly accumulate in
secondary recirculating regions behind the bump. At higher Stokes numbers, the
particles create reflection layers of high concentration due to their inertia
as they are diverted by the bump. The fluid flow is less influential and this
enables the particles to enter the recirculating region by rebounding off walls
and create a focus of high particle concentration.

On-the-fly particle metrology in hollow-core photonic crystal fibre,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09469v1,"['Abhinav Sharma', 'Shangran Xie', 'Richard Zeltner', 'Philip St. J. Russell']","  Efficient monitoring of airborne particulate matter (PM), especially
particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 um (PM2.5), is crucial for
improving public health. Reliable information on the concentration, size
distribution and chemical characteristics of PMs is key to evaluating air
pollution and identifying its sources. Standard methods for PM2.5
characterization require sample collection from the atmosphere and
post-analysis using sophisticated equipment in a laboratory environment, and
are normally very time-consuming. Although optical methods based on analysis of
scattering of free-space laser beams or evanescent fields are in principle
suitable for real-time particle counting and sizing, lack of knowledge of the
refractive index in these methods not only leads to inevitable sizing ambiguity
but also prevents identification of the particle material. In the case of
evanescent wave detection, the system lifetime is strongly limited by adhesion
of particles to the surfaces. Here we report a novel technique for airborne
particle metrology based on hollow-core photonic crystal fibre. It offers in
situ particle counting, sizing and refractive index measurement with
effectively unlimited device lifetime, and relies on optical forces that
automatically capture airborne particles in front of the hollow core and propel
them into the fibre. The resulting transmission drop, together with the
time-of-flight of the particles passing through the fibre, provide unambiguous
mapping of particle size and refractive index with high accuracy. The technique
represents a considerable advance over currently available real-time particle
metrology systems, and can be directly applied to monitoring air pollution in
the open atmosphere as well as precise particle characterization in a local
environment such as a closed room or a reaction vessel.

Toward automated and real-time 3D PTV measurements for microfluidics,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01912v1,"['Massimiliano Rossi', 'Rune Barnkob']","  The increasing use of microfluidics in industrial, biomedical, and clinical
applications requires a more and more precise control of the microfluidic flows
and suspended particles or cells. This leads to higher demands in
three-dimensional and automated particle tracking methods, e.g. for use in
feedback-control systems. In order to meet these demands, we present in this
work an algorithm for performing General Defocusing Particle Tracking (GDPT) in
a fast, versatile, and automated manner. GDPT is a 3D particle tracking method
based on defocused particle images which is suitable for non-expert users and
requires only standard laboratory equipment. The presented algorithm includes
(i) an automatic identification of particles via the a priori measured
reference set of particle images, (ii) a quick depth coordinate determination
through a prediction of expected particle image similarities, and (iii) an
iterative approach for detection of overlapping particles. We show that the
algorithm is versatile and can be applied to different types of images
(darkfield and brightfield) and that it is not sensitive to background or
illumination fluctuations. We use synthetic image sets of varying particle
concentration to evaluate the performance of the algorithm in terms of detected
depth coordinate uncertainty, particle detection rate, and processing time. The
algorithm is especially suitable for applications where real-time feedback
control is needed and we illustrate this by using synthetic images to simulate
a real-time experiment of particles undergoing acoustophoresis in a
microfluidic device. The simulated experiment showed that the processing time
could be significantly reduced using the presented algorithm without
compromising the reliability of the detection. Our results pave the road for
real-time applications of GDPT and for its improvements in processing accuracy,
precision, and time.

"Direct Numerical Simulation of Rotating Ellipsoidal Particles using
  Moving Nonconforming Schwarz-Spectral Element Method",http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04393v1,"['Ketan Mittal', 'Som Dutta', 'Paul Fischer']","  We present application of a highly-scalable overlapping grid-based
nonconforming Schwarz-spectral element method (Schwarz-SEM) to study the
dynamics of rotating ellipsoidal particles. The current study is one of the
first to explore the effect of rotation on ellipsoidal particles using fully
resolved simulations (direct numerical simulation). The rotating ellipsoidal
particles show substantial difference in the dynamics of the flow, when
compared against non-rotating particles. The difference is primarily due to
periodic attachment and separation of the flow to the surface of the particle
for the rotating cases, which results in a higher drag on the particles when
compared to the corresponding non-rotating cases. The dynamics is also
different from a rotating spherical particle, where a steady shear layer
develops near the surface of the sphere. For the rotating ellipsoidal
particles, this mechanism results in a phase-difference between the position of
observed maximum and minimum drag, and the position of expected maximum and
minimum drag (i.e., maximum and minimum projected area). A similar
phase-difference is also observed for the lift acting on the rotating
ellipsoidal particles. The results presented here demonstrate the importance of
explicitly modeling the shape and rotation of particles when we study the
dynamics of non-spherical particles. Finally, the study also validates the use
of non-conforming Schwarz-SEM for tackling problems in fully resolved
particulate flow dynamics.

HOP: A New Group-Finding Algorithm for N-body Simulations,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9712200v1,"['Daniel J. Eisenstein', 'Piet Hut']","  We describe a new method (HOP) for identifying groups of particles in N-body
simulations. Having assigned to every particle an estimate of its local
density, we associate each particle with the densest of the N_hop particles
nearest to it. Repeating this process allows us to trace a path, within the
particle set itself, from each particle in the direction of increasing density.
The path ends when it reaches a particle that is its own densest neighbor; all
particles reaching the same such particle are identified as a group. Combined
with an adaptive smoothing kernel for finding the densities, this method is
spatially adaptive, coordinate-free, and numerically straight-forward. One can
proceed to process the output by truncating groups at a particular density
contour and combining groups that share a (possibly different) density contour.
While the resulting algorithm has several user-chosen parameters, we show that
the results are insensitive to most of these, the exception being the outer
density cutoff of the groups.

Nonlinear Particle Acceleration in Relativistic Shocks,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0202106v2,"['Donald C. Ellison', 'Glen P. Double']","  Monte Carlo techniques are used to model nonlinear particle acceleration in
parallel collisionless shocks of various speeds, including mildly relativistic

particles modifies the shock structure and causes the compression ratio, r, to
increase above test-particle values. Modified shocks with Lorentz factors less
than about 3 can have compression ratios considerably greater than 3 and the
momentum distribution of energetic particles no longer follows a power law
relation. These results may be important for the interpretation of gamma-ray
bursts if mildly relativistic internal and/or afterglow shocks play an
important role accelerating particles that produce the observed radiation. For
shock Lorentz factors greater than about 10, r approaches 3 and the so-called
`universal' test-particle result of N(E) proportional to E^{-2.3} is obtained
for sufficiently energetic particles. In all cases, the absolute normalization
of the particle distribution follows directly from our model assumptions and is

of the granular material times an average vibration velocity times a function
of the ratio of particle to vibration velocity. `Particle-wall' dissipation has
been neglected in all theories up to now, but can play an important role when
the granular material is dilute. The ratio between gravitational potential
energy and kinetic energy can vary by as much as a factor of 3. Previous

Sites with double occupancy are active, and their particles may be transfered

$\lambda=0$ each one of the two particles is independently assigned to one of
the two first neighbors and the original stochastic sandpile model is
recovered. For $\lambda=1$ exactly one particle will be placed on each first

one helicity state. (For invariance under parity, they need two.) We show that
a massive vector particle can exist only in the helicity-0 state, if it is
composed of a fermion-antifermion pair and they are massless. This requires the
mass to be generated by the interaction between the massless particles. An
interaction of the form Psi^dagger i gamma_4 gamma_mu Psi is attractive between

Time Extended Measurement of the Position of a Particle,http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0512160v1,['Francesc S. Roig'],"  The von Neumann interaction between a particle and an apparatus has been
considered in the measurement of the position of a particle when the
interaction lasts for a finite amount of time. When the measurement has finite
duration, both the motion of the pointer and the particle influence the result
of the measurement. Provided that the particle is in an eigenstate of its
position at the start of the measurement, the pointer will indicate the
arithmetic average between the initial and final position of the particle.
Furthermore, the probability that the pointer will indicate a given average
value is equal to the transition probability for the undisturbed particle to
experience the change in position. If the initial state of the pointer is a
narrow wavepacket, then for any initial state of the particle, the measurement
yields, approximately, the undisturbed probability distribution for the
position of the particle at the end of the measurement.

Are Particles Self-Organized Systems?,http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.3300v1,['Vladimir A. Manasson'],"  Elementary particles possess quantized values of charge and internal angular
momentum or spin. These characteristics do not change when the particles
interact with other particles or fields as long as they preserve their
entities. Quantum theory does not explain this quantization. It is introduced
into the theory a priori. An interacting particle is an open system and thus
does not obey conservation laws. However, an open system may create dynamically
stable states with unchanged dynamical variables via self-organization. In
self-organized systems stability is achieved through the interplay of
nonlinearity and dissipation. Can self-organization be responsible for particle
formation? In this paper we develop and analyze a particle model based on
qualitative dynamics and the Feigenbaum universality. This model demonstrates
that elementary particles can be described as self-organized dynamical systems
belonging to a wide class of systems characterized by a hierarchy of
period-doubling bifurcations. This semi-qualitative heuristic model gives
possible explanations for charge and action quantization, and the origination
and interrelation between the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces, as well
as SU(2) symmetry. It also provides a basis for particle taxonomy endorsed by
the Standard Model. The key result is the discovery that the Planck constant is
intimately related to elementary charge.

the KNO scaling of the particle multiplicity distributions as measured in p+p

single particle momentum spectrum at high momenta. Moreover, the mean
multiplicity of heavy particles also decreases as a function of the particle
mass according to a power law. Finally, it is shown that the dependence of the

on the particle energy. These results resemble the properties of particle

to distinguish single-particle states from multi-particle states in lattice QCD

criteria is in principle only valid for a stable particle or a narrow

of the corresponding spectral weight resembles that of a multi-particle state
instead of a single-particle one. For an unstable $V$-particle in the Lee
model, the transition from single-particle to multi-particle volume dependence
is governed by the ratio of its physical width to the typical level spacing in
the finite volume. We estimate this ratio for practical lattice QCD simulations
and find that, for most cases, the resonance studied in lattice QCD simulations
still resembles the single particle behavior.

introducing a 1-D statistical description of the fluid exclusively based on the

The concept of particle in Quantum Field theory,http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.0178v1,['Eliano Pessa'],"  Despite its name, Quantum Field Theory (QFT) has been built to describe
interactions between localizable particles. For this reason the actual
formalism of QFT is partly based on a suitable generalization of the one

existence within QFT of non-equivalent representations implies the existence of
field theories allowing, within the same theory, different, inequivalent,
descriptions of particles. This led some authors to claim that in QFT the
concept itself of particle should be abandoned. In this paper we will shortly
discuss the validity of this claim, as well as the possibilities, so far
existing, of building alternative versions of QFT, not designed in advance to
allow some kind of particle representation. We will also spend some words about

the localization of one particle becomes dependent on whether the other
particle is localized or not. On long time scales, the localized particles show
oscillatory correlations within the localization length. These effects can be
observed in Anderson localization of non-classical light and ultra-cold atoms.

amorphous packing known as ""random close packing"" (RCP). This structure is of

criteria for being random, we also observe a small fraction (less than 3%) of
tiny crystallites (4 particles or fewer). These regions pack slightly better

our sample at long length scales is non-zero, $S(0) \approx 0.049$, suggesting
that there are long wavelength density fluctuations in our sample, perhaps due
to the tiny crystallites. Our results suggest that experimentally realizable

where the background atoms are in thermal equilibrium. As in the standard
Lorentz gas, we assume that the particle is negligibly light in comparison with
the background atoms. The thermal motion of atoms causes the average particle
speed to grow. In the case of the hard-sphere particle-atom interaction, the
temporal growth is ballistic, while generally it is sub-linear. For the
particle-atom potential that diverges as r^{-\lambda} in the small separation
limit, the average particle speed grows as t^{\lambda /(2(d-1)+ \lambda)} in d
dimensions. The particle displacement exhibits a universal growth, linear in
time and the average (thermal) speed of the atoms. Surprisingly, the asymptotic
growth is independent on the gas density and the particle-atom interaction. The
velocity and position distributions approach universal scaling forms which are
non-Gaussian. We determine the velocity distribution in arbitrary dimension and
for arbitrary interaction exponent \lambda. For the hard-sphere particle-atom

Non-Entangling Channels for Multiple Collisions of Quantum Wave Packets,http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.5421v1,"['Walter Hahn', 'Boris V. Fine']","  We consider multiple collisions of quantum wave packets in one dimension. The

between the heavier one and the wall. Both particles are initially represented

is presented on the basis of a new method. The idea of the method is to
decompose the two-particle wave function into a continuous superposition of
terms (channels), such that the multiple collisions within each channel do not
lead to subsequent entanglement between the two particles. For each channel,
the time evolution of the two-particle wave function is completely determined
by the motion of the corresponding classical point-like particles; therefore
the whole quantum problem is reduced to a classical calculation. The
calculation based on the above method reveals the following unexpected result:
The entanglement between the two particles first increases with time due to the
collisions, but then it begins to decrease, disappearing completely when the
light particle becomes too slow to catch up with the heavy one.

its velocity in the locally nonrotaing frame directly. In doing so, we do not
assume that particles move along geodesics. Usually, a particle reaches a
horizon having the velocity equals that of light. However, there is also case
of ""critical"" particles for which this is not so. It is just the pair of usual

distinguishable due to the finiteness of local frequency. Thus, both approach

deflection under the gravitational potential of our own galaxy. The deflection
angle depends on the particle velocity and therefore non-relativistic particles
will be deflected more than relativistic ones. If these particles can be
detected through neutrino telescopes, cosmic ray detectors or directional dark
matter detectors, their arrival directions would appear aligned on the sky
along the source-lens direction. On top of this deflection, the arrival
direction of non-relativistic particles is displaced with respect to the
relativistic counterpart also due to the relative motion of the source with
respect to the observer; this induces an alignment of detections along the sky
projection of the source trajectory. The final alignment will be given by a
combination of the directions induced by lensing and source proper motion. We
derive the deflection-velocity relation for the Milky Way halo and suggest that
searching for alignments on detection maps of particle telescopes could be a

inertial mass of a particle we need to know its acceleration under some force
in an inertial reference frame, which itself is defined by the motion of its
background objects. Therefore, the inertial mass of a particle is not
completely its intrinsic property and depends on the position of the particle
itself and and all other particles (which we refer as background) in the
universe. But the background of a particle keeps on fluctuating randomly due to
different physical phenomenon in the universe. Therefore, the exact position or
the mass of a particle can not be determined at any time, without having full
information about all the other particles in the universe. Hence, in this
paper, we define the dynamics of a particle statistically. We show that the
fluctuations in the background of an object contributes to an extra energy term
in the total energy of the particle. If we treat this extra energy term as the
quantum potential then it leads to the Schrodinger equation. Some examples are
also given to show how a classical interpretation can be given to some quantum

Pileup Per Particle Identification,http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.6013v2,"['Daniele Bertolini', 'Philip Harris', 'Matthew Low', 'Nhan Tran']","  We propose a new method for pileup mitigation by implementing ""pileup per

shape $\alpha$ which probes the collinear versus soft diffuse structure in the
neighborhood of the particle. The former is indicative of particles originating
from the hard scatter and the latter of particles originating from pileup
interactions. The distribution of $\alpha$ for charged pileup, assumed as a
proxy for all pileup, is used on an event-by-event basis to calculate a weight
for each particle. The weights describe the degree to which particles are
pileup-like and are used to rescale their four-momenta, superseding the need
for jet-based corrections. Furthermore, the algorithm flexibly allows
combination with other, possibly experimental, probabilistic information
associated with particles such as vertexing and timing performance. We
demonstrate the algorithm improves over existing methods by looking at jet
$p_T$ and jet mass. We also find an improvement on non-jet quantities like

elastic microspheres, are considered to be much smaller than the acoustic
wavelength. In this so-called Rayleigh limit, the acoustic interaction forces
between the particles are well approximated by gradients of pair-interaction

only do we predict forces orders of magnitude larger than expected from
ideal-fluid theory, but for certain relevant choices of materials, we also find
a sign change in the acoustic radiation force on different-sized but otherwise
identical particles. This phenomenon may possibly be exploited in handling of
submicrometer-sized particles such as bacteria and vira in lab-on-a-chip

non-spherical (spheroidal) isolated and particle pairs in a viscous fluid via
numerical simulations using the Immersed Boundary Method. The simulations
performed here show that the critical Galileo number for the onset of secondary
motions decreases as the spheroid aspect ratio departs from 1. Above this
critical threshold, oblate particles perform a zigzagging motion whereas
prolate particles rotate around the vertical axis while having their broad side
facing the falling direction. Instabilities of the vortices in the wake follow
when farther increasing the Galileo number. We also study the
drafting-kissing-tumbling associated with the settling of particle pairs. We
find that the interaction time increases significantly for non-spherical
particles and, more interestingly, spheroidal particles are attracted from
larger lateral displacements. This has important implications for the
estimation of collision kernels and can result in increasing clustering in
suspensions of sedimenting spheroids.

smaller particles show oscillatory movements. The rate of phase modulation is
optimized for separation of target particles from the relationship between mean

Numerically stable online estimation of variance in particle filters,http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01001v1,"['Jimmy Olsson', 'Randal Douc']","  This paper discusses variance estimation in sequential Monte Carlo methods,
alternatively termed particle filters. The variance estimator that we propose

to be estimated in a single run of the particle filter by tracing the
genealogical history of the particles. However, due particle lineage
degeneracy, the estimator of the mentioned work becomes numerically unstable as
the number of sequential particle updates increases. Thus, by tracing only a
part of the particles' genealogy rather than the full one, our estimator gains
long-term numerical stability at the cost of a bias. The scope of the
genealogical tracing is regulated by a lag, and under mild, easily checked
model assumptions, we prove that the bias tends to zero geometrically fast as
the lag increases. As confirmed by our numerical results, this allows the bias
to be tightly controlled also for moderate particle sample sizes.

parameter. It is shown that sub-Kolmogorov particles/droplets modify the energy
spectrum leading to a scaling law, $E(k)\propto k^{-4}$, that emerges at small
scales where the particle forcing balances the viscous dissipation. This regime
is confirmed by Direct Numerical Simulation data of a particle-laden

regularised model to capture the relevant small-scale physics. The energy
budget in spectral space, extended to account for the inter-phase momentum
exchange, highlights how the particle provide an energy sink in the production

stars the young Sun was more active and probably produced enough high energy
particles to explain those anomalies. We want to study the interaction of
stellar energetic particles with the gas component of the disk and identify
possible observational tracers of this interaction. We use a 2D radiation
thermo-chemical protoplanetary disk code to model a disk representative for T

Distribution of randomly diffusing particles in inhomogeneous media,http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.10244v1,"['Yiwei Li', 'Osman Kahraman', 'Christoph A. Haselwandter']","  Diffusion can be conceptualized, at microscopic scales, as the random hopping
of particles between neighboring lattice sites. In the case of diffusion in
inhomogeneous media, distinct spatial domains in the system may yield distinct
particle hopping rates. Starting from the master equations (MEs) governing
diffusion in inhomogeneous media we derive here, for arbitrary spatial
dimensions, the deterministic lattice equations (DLEs) specifying the average
particle number at each lattice site for randomly diffusing particles in
inhomogeneous media. We consider the case of free diffusion with no steric
constraints on the maximum particle number per lattice site as well as the case
of diffusion under steric constraints imposing a maximum particle
concentration. We find, for both transient and asymptotic regimes, excellent
agreement between the DLEs and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of the MEs. The
DLEs provide a computationally efficient method for predicting the (average)
distribution of randomly diffusing particles in inhomogeneous media, with the
number of DLEs associated with a given system being independent of the number
of particles in the system. From the DLEs we obtain general analytic
expressions for the steady-state particle distributions for free diffusion and,
in special cases, diffusion under steric constraints in inhomogeneous media. We
find that, in the steady state of the system, the average fraction of particles
in a given domain is independent of most system properties, such as the
arrangement and shape of domains, and only depends on the number of lattice
sites in each domain, the hopping rates, the number of distinct particle
species, and the total number of particles of each particle species in the

inhomogeneous particle hopping rates in setting the particle distributions in

In the first step, we calculate the electrostatic potential inside the system
exactly as well as within the widely used superposition approximation. Then
these results are used to calculate the surface and line interaction energy
densities between the particles. Contrary to the case of identical particles,
depending upon the parameters of the system, we obtain that both the surface
and the line interaction can vary non-monotonically with varying separation
between the particles and the superposition approximation fails to predict the
correct qualitative behaviours in most cases. Additionally, the superposition
approximation is unable to predict the energy contributions quantitatively even
at large distances. We also provide expression for the constant (independent of
the inter-particle separation) interaction parameters, i.e., the surface
tension, the line tension and the interfacial tension. Our results are expected
to be of use for modelling particle-interaction at fluid interfaces and, in
particular, for emulsion stabilization using oppositely charged particles.

force on particle A and the work done on particle B of this machine. The
probability density function for stochastic efficiency is computed for all
time. Numerical simulations are also done to verify the analytical results.

stochastic equation. This is much like Nelson's stochastic mechanics which also
assumes a fluctuating particle as the basis of the microstates. The uniqueness
of ED as an entropic inference of particles allows one to continuously
transition between fluctuating particles and the smooth trajectories assumed in

statistics depend on the Stokes number, $St$, defined as the ratio of the
particle friction timescale, $\tau_{\rm p} $, to the Kolmogorov timescale in
the flow. In the dissipation range, the clustering intensity strongly peaks at
$St \simeq 1$, and the RDF for $St \sim 1$ shows a fast power-law increase
toward small scales, suggesting that turbulent clustering may considerably
enhance the particle collision rate. Clustering at inertial-range scales is of
particular interest to the problem of planetesimal formation. At these scales,
the strongest clustering is from particles with $\tau_{\rm p}$ in the inertial
range. Clustering of these particles occurs primarily around a scale where the
eddy turnover time is $\sim\tau_{\rm p}$. Particles of different sizes tend to
cluster at different locations, leading to flat RDFs between different

overall clustering strength decreases as the particle size distribution
broadens. We discuss particle clustering in recent models for planetesimal
formation. We point out that, in the model based on turbulent clustering of

$2\Delta(0)/T_{\text{c}}^{\text{MF}}$, from BCS through BEC regimes, in the
framework of a pairing fluctuation theory which includes self-consistently the
contributions of finite-momentum pairs. These pairs necessarily lead to a
pseudogap in single particle excitation spectrum above and below
$T_{\text{c}}$. We sum over the infinite particle-hole ladder diagrams so that
the particle-particle and particle-hole $T$-matrices are entangled with each
other. We find that the particle-hole susceptibility has a complex dynamical
structure, with strong momentum and frequency dependencies, and is sensitive to
temperature, gap size and interaction strength. We conclude that neglecting the
self-energy feedback causes a serious over-estimate of the particle-hole
susceptibility. In the BCS limit, the particle-hole channel effect may be
approximated by the same reduction in the overall pairing strength so that the
ratio $2\Delta(0)/T_{\text{c}}$ is unaffected, in agreement with Gor'kov
\textit{et al.} to the leading order. However, the effect becomes more complex
and pronounced in the crossover regime, where the particle-hole susceptibility
is reduced by both a smaller Fermi surface and a big (pseudo)gap. Deep in the
BEC regime, the particle-hole channel contributions drop to zero. We propose
that precision measurements of the magnetic field for Feshbach resonance at low
temperatures as a function of density can be used to quantify the particle-hole
susceptibility and test different theories.

"Long-range two-particle correlations of strange hadrons with charged
  particles in pPb and PbPb collisions at LHC energies",http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3392v2,[' CMS Collaboration'],"  Measurements of two-particle angular correlations between an identified
strange hadron (K0S or Lambda/anti-Lambda) and a charged particle, emitted in
pPb collisions, are presented over a wide range in pseudorapidity and full
azimuth. The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately
35 inverse nanobarns, were collected at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy
(sqrt(s[NN])) of 5.02 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC. The results are
compared to semi-peripheral PbPb collision data at sqrt(s[NN]) = 2.76 TeV,
covering similar charged-particle multiplicities in the events. The observed
azimuthal correlations at large relative pseudorapidity are used to extract the
second-order (v[2]) and third-order (v[3]) anisotropy harmonics of K0S and
Lambda/anti-Lambda particles. These quantities are studied as a function of the
charged-particle multiplicity in the event and the transverse momentum of the
particles. For high-multiplicity pPb events, a clear particle species
dependence of v[2] and v[3] is observed. For pt < 2 GeV, the v[2] and v[3]
values of K0S particles are larger than those of Lambda/anti-Lambda particles
at the same pt. This splitting effect between two particle species is found to
be stronger in pPb than in PbPb collisions in the same multiplicity range. When
divided by the number of constituent quarks and compared at the same transverse
kinetic energy per quark, both v[2] and v[3] for K0S particles are observed to
be consistent with those for Lambda/anti-Lambda particles at the 10% level in
pPb collisions. This consistency extends over a wide range of particle
transverse kinetic energy and event multiplicities.

exciting and practical research topic in nanotechnology. This study deals with
development of gold particles at varying precursor concentration in a
custom-built setup. Under the tuned ratio of bipolar pulse OFF to ON time, tiny
particles of different sizes and shapes develop depending on the amount of gold
precursor. When compact monolayer assembly is formed on solution surface, nano
energy in packet shapes bind gold atoms in own shape. Between 0.07 mM to 0.90
mM precursor concentration, tiny particles develop in both triangular and
non-triangular shapes. Tiny particles of triangular shape develop in a large
number at precursor concentration 0.30 mM and 0.60 mM. Hence, nanoparticles and
particles also developed in different geometrical shapes. Such tiny particles
pack due to the exerted force in immersing format, where made structures of
smooth elements assemble to develop nanoparticles and particles of different
shapes. Tiny particles of non-geometrical shapes do not assemble at a common
point and their assembling develops a nanoparticle or particle of distorted or
spherical shape. This occurs mainly when precursor concentration is 0.05 mM and
1.20 mM. At 50 sccm Argon flow rate, nanoparticles and particles develop in the
same shapes as in case of 100 sccm. For different precursor concentrations,
different colors of solutions indicate different features of nanoparticles and
particles. This study clarifies the necessary concentration of precursor to
develop colloids of different sizes.

"A computational study of particle deposition patterns from a circular
  laminar jet",http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04605v2,['James Q. Feng'],"  Particle deposition patterns on the plate of inertial impactor with circular
laminar jet are investigated numerically with a Lagrangian solver implemented
within the framework of the OpenFOAM$^{\circledR}$ CFD package. Effects of
taper angle of the nozzle channel and jet-to-plate distance are evaluated. The
results show that tapered nozzle tends to deposit more particles toward the
circular spot edge than straight nozzle. At jet Reynolds number $Re = 1132$, a
tapered nozzle deposits particles to form a pattern with a high density ring
toward the deposition spot edge, especially for particle Stokes number $St >
St_{50}$, which is absent with a straight nozzle. Increasing the jet-to-plate
distance tends to reduce the value of particle density peak near deposition
spot edge. Reducing $Re$ to $283$ (e.g., for $300$ ccm flow through a $1.5$ mm
diameter jet nozzle) yields particle deposition patterns without the high
density ring at the deposition spot edge when the same tapered nozzle is used.
The particle deposition patterns with the straight nozzle at $Re = 283$ exhibit
further reduced particle density around the spot edge such that the particle
density profile appears more or less like a Gaussian function. In general, the
effect of reducing $Re$ on particle deposition pattern seems to be similar to
increasing the jet-to-plate distance. The computed particle deposition
efficiency $\eta$ shows the fact that very fine particles with extremely small
values of $St$ near the jet axis always impact the center of plate, indicating
that the value of $\eta$ does not approach zero with a substantial reduction of
$St$. Such a ""small particle contamination"" typically amounts to $\sim 10\%$ of
small particles (with $\sqrt{St} < 0.1$) at $Re \sim 1000$ and $\sim 5\%$ at
$Re \sim 300$, which may not be negligible in data analysis with inertial

"Investigating the Settling Dynamics of Cohesive Silt Particles With
  Particle-Resolving Simulations",http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04582v2,"['Rui Sun', 'Heng Xiao', 'Honglei Sun']","  The settling of cohesive sediment is ubiquitous in aquatic environments. In
the settling process, the silt particles show behaviors that are different from
non-cohesive particles due to the influence of inter-particle cohesive force.
While it is a consensus that cohesive behaviors depend on the characteristics
of sediment particles (e.g., Bond number, particle size distribution), little
is known about the exact influence of these characteristics on the cohesive
behaviors. In the present work, three-dimensional settling process is
investigated numerically by using CFD--DEM (Computational Fluid
Dynamics--Discrete Element Method). The inter-particle collision force, the van
der Waals force, and the fluid--particle interaction forces are considered. The
numerical model is used to simulate the hindered settling process of silt based
on the experimental setup in the literature. The results obtained in the
simulations, including the structural densities of the beds, the characteristic
lines, and the particle terminal velocity, are in good agreement with the
experimental observations in the literature. To the authors' knowledge, this is
the first time that the influences of non-dimensional Bond number and particle
polydispersity on the structural densities of silt beds have been investigated
separately. The results demonstrate that the cohesive behavior of silt in the
settling process is attributed to both the cohesion among silt particles
themselves and the particle polydispersity. To guide to the macro-scale
modeling of cohesive silt sedimentation, the collision frequency functions
obtained in the numerical simulations are also presented based on the
micromechanics of particles. The results obtained by using CFD--DEM indicate
that the binary collision theory over-estimated the particle collision
frequency in the flocculation process at high solid volume fraction.

formed via mutual, inelastic collisions of spherical particles due to adhering
forces between particles in granular streams. To investigate the condition of
agglomerate formation in granular streams, we conducted laboratory experiments
of granular streams using both spherical and irregular, non-spherical

a centrifugal separation method, in contrast to the previous study in which
atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used. This enabled simultaneous measurements
of multiple particles of various shapes for a statistical analysis of the
results. With similar relative velocities and adhesion values, irregular
particles were found to form agglomerates much more easily than spherical
particles. The axial ratio of the agglomerates of spherical particles and
irregular particles was similar and was in accordance with those observed in
previous laboratory studies, whereas the size of the agglomerates of irregular
particles was larger than the size of spherical particles. The degree of
agglomeration and the size of agglomerates can be used as an indicator of the

to suspended particles in a turbulent gas-particle suspension. Turbulence
augmentation is due to the enhancement of fluctuations by wakes behind

increased dissipation due to the particle drag. In order to examine the
turbulence attenuation mechanism, Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of a
particle-gas suspension are carried out at a Reynolds number of about 3333
based on the average gas velocity $\bar{u}$, channel width $h$, and the gas
kinematic viscosity. The particle Reynolds number based on the particle
diameter $d_p$, gas kinematic viscosity and the flow velocity $\bar{u}$ is
about 42 and the Stokes number is in the range $7-450$. The particle volume
fraction is in the range $0-2 \times 10^{-3}$, and the particle mass loading is
in the range $0-9$. As the volume fraction is increased, a discontinuous
decrease in the turbulent velocity fluctuations is observed at a critical
volume fraction. from $9 \times 10^{-4}$ to $1 \times 10^{-3}$. There is a
reduction, by one order of magnitude, in the mean square fluctuating velocities
in all directions and in the Reynolds stress. Though there is a modest increase
in the energy dissipation due to particle drag, this increase is smaller than
the decrease in the turbulent energy production; moreover, there is a decrease
in the total energy dissipation rate when there is turbulence collapse. Thus,
turbulence attenuation appears to be due to a disruption of the turbulence
production mechanism, and not due to the increased dissipation due to the
particles. There is a discontinuous collapse in the turbulence intensities at a
critical particle loading, instead of the continuous decrease as the particle

Non-linear shock acceleration in the presence of seed particles,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0310507v1,['Pasquale Blasi'],"  Particles crossing repeatedly the surface of a shock wave can be energized by
first order Fermi acceleration. The linear theory is successful in describing
the acceleration process as long as the pressure of the accelerated particles
remains negligible compared to the kinetic pressure of the incoming gas (the
so-called test particle approximation). When this condition is no longer
fulfilled, the shock is modified by the pressure of the accelerated particles
in a nonlinear way, namely the spectrum of accelerated particles and the shock
structure determine each other. In this paper we present the first description
of the nonlinear regime of shock acceleration when the shock propagates in a
medium where seed particles are already present. This case may apply for
instance to supernova shocks propagating into the interstellar medium, where
cosmic rays are in equipartition with the gas pressure. We find that the
appearance of multiple solutions, previously found in alternative descriptions
of the nonlinear regime, occurs also for the case of reacceleration of seed
particles. Moreover, for parameters of concern for supernova shocks, the shock
is likely to turn nonlinear mainly due to the presence of the pre-existing
cosmic rays, rather than due to the acceleration of new particles from the
thermal pool. We investigate here the onset of the nonlinear regime for the
three following cases: 1) seed particles in equipartition with the gas
pressure; 2) particles accelerated from the thermal pool; 3) combination of 1)

relativity can be made compatible with quantum mechanics by using the field
equations of general relativity to construct a Robertson-Walker metric for a
quantum particle so that the line element of the particle can be transformed
entirely to that of the Minkowski spacetime, which is assumed by a quantum
observer, and the spacetime dynamics of the particle described by a Minkowski
observer takes the form of quantum mechanics. Spacetime structure of a quantum
particle may have either positive or negative curvature. However, in order to
be describable using the familiar framework of quantum mechanics, the spacetime
structure of a quantum particle must be ""quantised"" by an introduction of the
imaginary number $i$. If a particle has a positive curvature then the
quantisation is equivalent to turning the pseudo-Riemannian spacetime of the
particle into a Riemannian spacetime. This means that it is assumed the
particle is capable of measuring its temporal distance like its spatial
distances. On the other hand, when a particle has a negative curvature and a
negative energy density then quantising the spacetime structure of the particle
is equivalent to viewing the particle as if it had a positive curvature and a
positive energy density.

Multifractal concentrations of inertial particles in smooth random flows,http://arxiv.org/abs/nlin/0402024v1,['Jeremie Bec'],"  Collisionless suspensions of inertial particles (finite-size impurities) are
studied in 2D and 3D spatially smooth flows. Tools borrowed from the study of
random dynamical systems are used to identify and to characterise in full
generality the mechanisms leading to the formation of strong inhomogeneities in
the particle concentration.
  Phenomenological arguments are used to show that in 2D, heavy particles form
dynamical fractal clusters when their Stokes number (non-dimensional viscous
friction time) is below some critical value. Numerical simulations provide
strong evidence for this threshold in both 2D and 3D and for particles not only
heavier but also lighter than the carrier fluid. In 2D, light particles are
found to cluster at discrete (time-dependent) positions and velocities in some
range of the dynamical parameters (the Stokes number and the mass density ratio
between fluid and particles). This regime is absent in 3D, where evidence is
that the Hausdorff dimension of clusters in phase space (position-velocity)
remains always above two.
  After relaxation of transients, the phase-space density of particles becomes
a singular random measure with non-trivial multiscaling properties. Theoretical
results about the projection of fractal sets are used to relate the
distribution in phase space to the distribution of the particle positions.
Multifractality in phase space implies also multiscaling of the spatial
distribution of the mass of particles. Two-dimensional simulations, using
simple random flows and heavy particles, allow the accurate determination of
the scaling exponents: anomalous deviations from self-similar scaling are
already observed for Stokes numbers as small as $10^{-4}$.

Characterization of Fundamental Particles,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0009085v4,['Ben J Baten'],"  This report provides an alternative to the Standard Model of particle
physics. The model described here is based on results from Quantum Field
Mechanics, according to which all fundamental particles and interactions
originate from the interaction of two pre-space/pre-time protofields. In
contrast with the Standard Model, (virtual) interaction-particles are absent in
the description of any of the four fundamental interactions. Electrons perform
a single quantum beat process while mesons and baryons have, respectively, two
and three bound quantum beat processes. Quantum Field Mechanics suggests that
the charge of an electron and positron can be identified with the two possible
phases of a quantum beat process as observed in the electromagnetic protofield.
This report assumes that short-range binding interaction between quantum beat
processes has a masking effect on the externally observable charge of hadrons.
Using this assumption, the internal structure of particles is derived from
their known particle charges and relative masses. The particle structures are
used to obtain the so-called charge-quantum phase law. The fractional charge of
quantum beat processes inside a particle is deduced by rewriting the
charge-quantum phase law in terms of a linear combination of charge
contributions of individual constituent quantum beat processes. Strangeness and
isospin are mathematically defined in terms of the quantum beat phases of sets
of particles of the same type. Application of conservation laws to particle
processes leads to relations between quantum phase, strangeness and isospin.

assumed that such a motion leads not only to the spatial oscillation of the

well. This phenomenon culminating in the anisotropic pulsation of the particle
is associated with the notion of spin. The particle-space interaction is
treated as the origin of the matter waves, which are identified with the
particle inertia and inertons surrounding the moving particle are considered as
carriers of its inert properties. Inertons are also identified with real
carriers of the gravitational interaction and the range of the particle
gravitational potential is evaluated by the inerton cloud amplitude

particle position. The effect of the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence on particle
velocity dispersions is quantified for solids of different stopping times t_s,

The dispersion of the particle velocity magnitude, as well as that of the

require a large dynamic range in particle number. The underlying idea is that,
in order to calculate the collisional evolution of a system, some particle
interactions are more important than others and require more resolution, while
the behavior of the less important, usually of smaller mass, particles can be
considered collectively. In this approximation groups of identical particles,
sharing the same mass and structural parameters, operate as one unit. The
amount of grouping is determined by the zoom factor -- a free parameter that
determines on which particles the computational effort is focused. Two methods
for choosing the zoom factors are discussed: the `equal mass method,' in which
the groups trace the mass density of the distribution, and the `distribution
method,' which additionally follows fluctuations in the distribution. Both
methods achieve excellent correspondence with analytic solutions to the
Smoluchowski coagulation equation. The grouping method is furthermore applied
to simulations involving runaway kernels, where the particle interaction rate
is a strong function of particle mass, and to situations that include
catastrophic fragmentation. For the runaway simulations previous predictions
for the decrease of the runaway timescale with the initial number of particles

applications include modeling of dust coagulation, planetesimal accretion, and
the dynamical evolution of stars in large globular clusters. The proposed

aggregation and fragmentation of solid particles (dust grains, dust aggregates,
boulders) in various astrophysical settings, including protoplanetary disks,
planetary- and sub-stellar atmospheres and dense molecular cloud cores. Here we
describe a new algorithm that combines advantages of various standard methods
into one.
  Aims: The aim is to develop a method that 1) can solve for aggregation and
fragmentation, 2) can easily include the effect and evolution of grain
properties such as compactness, composition, etc., and 3) can be built as a
coagulation/fragmentation module into a hydrodynamics simulations.
  Methods: We develop a Monte-Carlo method in which we follow the 'life' of a
limited number of representative particles. Each of these particles is
associated with a certain fraction of the total dust mass and thereby
represents a large number of true particles which all are assumed to have the
same properties as their representative particle. Under the assumption that the
total number of true particles vastly exceeds the number of representative
particles, the chance of a representative particle colliding with another
representative particle is negligibly small, and we therefore ignore this
possibility. This now makes it possible to employ a statistical approach to the
evolution of the representative particles.
  Results: The method reproduces the known analytic solutions of simplified
coagulation kernels, and compares well to numerical results for Brownian motion

another kind and the total number of particles varies in time. The theory thus
extends the scope of the available and successful multiconfigurational
time-dependent Hartree methods -- which were solely formulated for and applied
to systems with a fixed number of particles -- to new physical systems and
problems. As a guiding example we treat explicitly a system where bosonic atoms
can combine to form bosonic molecules and vise versa. In the theory for
particle conversion, the time-dependent many-particle wavefunction is written
as a sum of configurations made of a different number of particles, and
assembled from sets of atomic and molecular orbitals. Both the expansion
coefficients and the orbitals forming the configurations are time-dependent
quantities that are fully determined according to the Dirac-Frenkel
time-dependent variational principle. Particular attention is paid to the
reduced density matrices of the many-particle wavefunction that appear in the
theory and enter the equations of motion. There are two kinds of reduced
density matrices: particle-conserving reduced density matrices which directly
only couple configurations with the same number of atoms and molecules, and
particle non-conserving reduced density matrices which couple configurations
with a different number of atoms and molecules. Closed-form and compact
equations of motion are derived for contact as well as general two-body

"Incompleteness of the particle dynamics in microcosm and the skeleton
  conception of elementary particles as overcoming of this incompleteness",http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.4562v3,['Yuri A. Rylov'],"  The skeleton conception of elementary particles is considered in the paper.
Conventional particle dynamics is formulated in an unaccomplished form, which
is adequate only in the continuous space-time geometry. The conventional
differential equations of the particle motion cannot be written in the discrete
space-time geometry. In the discrete space-time geometry the particle world
line is replaced by the world chain. The world chain links has a finite length
(not infinitesimal). The world chain appears to be stochastic. Statistical
description of stochastic world chains leads to the Schr\""{o}dinger equation,
if the elementary length of the geometry is chosen in a proper way. The quantum
principles are founded by existence of the discrete (and multivariant)
space-time geometry and lose the role of prime physical principles. In the
skeleton conception the particle is described by its skeleton (several rigidly
connected space-time points). Skeleton conception of the elementary particles
realizes a proper description of the particle state, which appears to be
adequate in a discrete space-time geometry. The particle dynamics takes the
form of a monistic conception, which is described completely in terms of the
world function of the space-time geometry. The skeleton conception accomplishes
the transition from nonrelativistic physics to the relativistic one and
realizes the total geometrization of particle dynamics.

coagulation and fragmentation of heavy drops moving in a turbulent flow. Such a

mean field based approaches for coagulation and fragmentation relying heavily
on parameterization and are for example unable to fully capture particle
inertia. We study the steady state that results from a balance between
coagulation and fragmentation and the impact of particle properties and flow
properties on this steady state. We compare two different fragmentation
mechanisms, size-limiting fragmentation where particles fragment when exceeding
a maximum size and shear fragmentation, where particles break up when local
shear forces in the flow exceed the binding force of the particle. For
size-limiting fragmentation the steady state is mainly influenced by the
maximum stable particle size, while particle and flow properties only influence
the approach to the steady state. For shear fragmentation both the approach to
the steady state and the steady state itself depend on the particle and flow
parameters. There we find scaling relationships between the steady state and
the particle and flow parameters that are determined by the stability condition
for fragmentation.

three-body, normal collisions between solid particles with a liquid coating

an apparatus inspired by the Newton's cradle desktop toy except with wetted
particles. Unlike previous work on two-body systems, which may either
agglomerate or rebound upon collision, four outcomes are possible in three-body
systems: fully agglomerated, Newton's cradle (striker and target particle it
strikes agglomerate), reverse Newton's cradle (targets agglomerate while
striker separates), and fully separated. Post-collisional velocities are
measured over a range of parameters. For all experiments, as the impact
velocity increases, the progression of outcomes observed is fully agglomerated,
reverse Newton's cradle, and fully separated. Notably, as the viscosity of the
oil increases, experiments reveal a decrease in the critical Stokes number (the
Stokes number that demarcates a transition from agglomeration to separation)
for both sets of adjacent particles. A scaling theory is developed based on
lubrication forces and particle deformation and elasticity. Unlike previous
work for two-particle systems, two pieces of physics are found to be critical
in the prediction of a regime map that is consistent with experiments: (i) an
additional resistance upon rebound of the target particles due to the
pre-existing liquid bridge between them (which has no counterpart in
two-particle collisions), and (ii) the addition of a rebound criterion due to
glass transition of the liquid layer at high pressure between colliding

Inertial effects on two-particle relative dispersion in turbulent flows,http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.1805v2,"['M. Gibert', 'H. Xu', 'E. Bodenschatz']","  We report experimental results on the relative motion of pairs of solid
spheric particles with initial separations in the inertial range of fully
developed turbulence in water. The particle densities were in the range of $1
\lessapprox \rho_{p}/\rho_{f} \lessapprox 8$, \textit{i.e.}, from neutrally
buoyant to highly inertial; and their sizes were of the Kolmogorov scale. For
all particles, we observed a Batchelor like regime, in which particles
separated ballistically. Similar to the Batchelor regime for tracers, this
regime was observed in the early stages of the relative separation for times $t
\lessapprox 0.1 t_0$ with $t_0$ determined by the turbulence energy dissipation
rate and the initial separation between particle pairs. In this time interval
heavier particles separated faster than fluid tracers. The second order
Eulerian velocity structure functions was found to increase with density. In
other words, both observations show that the relative velocity between inertial
particles was larger than that between tracers. Based on the widely used,
simplified equation of motion for inertial point-particles, we derived a model
that shows an increase in relative velocity between inertial particles. In its
scale dependence, however, it disagrees quantitatively with the experimental
results. This we attribute to the preferential sampling of the flow field by
inertial particles, which is not captured by the model.

substrate, it is possible for a ratchet effect to occur where the particles
undergo a net dc motion in response to an ac forcing. Ratchet effects have been
demonstrated in a variety of systems including colloids as well as magnetic
vortices in type-II superconductors. Here we examine the case of active matter
or self-driven particles interacting with asymmetric substrates. Active matter
systems include self-motile colloidal particles undergoing catalysis, swimming
bacteria, artificial swimmers, crawling cells, and motor proteins. We show that
a ratchet effect can arise in this type of system even in the absence of ac
forcing. The directed motion occurs for certain particle-substrate interaction
rules and its magnitude depends on the amount of time the particles spend
swimming in one direction before turning and swimming in a new direction. For
strictly Brownian particles there is no ratchet effect. If the particles
reflect off the barriers or scatter from the barriers according to Snell's law
there is no ratchet effect; however, if the particles can align with the
barriers or move along the barriers, directed motion arises. We also find that
under certain motion rules, particles accumulate along the walls of the
container in agreement with experiment. We also examine pattern formation for
synchronized particle motion. We discuss possible applications of this system
for self-assembly, extracting work, and sorting as well as future directions

demonstrated analytically that two-particle non-interacting quantum walks

The counting of DM particles in these decays is relevant to distinguish the

the heavy mother particles are pair-produced. We present new theoretical
results concerning the energy distribution of the decay products of a

feasibility of our method in investigating the stabilization symmetry, we apply
it in distinguishing the decay of a bottom quark partner into a b quark and one

Hydrodynamic Interactions of Self-Propelled Swimmers,http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.6133v2,"['John J. Molina', 'Yasuya Nakayama', 'Ryoichi Yamamoto']","  The hydrodynamic interactions of a suspension of self-propelled particles are
studied using a direct numerical simulation method which simultaneously solves
for the host fluid and the swimming particles. A modified version of the
""Smoothed Profile"" method (SPM) is developed to simulate microswimmers as
squirmers, which are spherical particles with a specified surface-tangential
slip velocity between the particles and the fluid. This simplified swimming
model allows one to represent different types of propulsion (pullers and
pushers) and is thus ideal to study the hydrodynamic interactions among
swimmers. We use the SPM to study the diffusive behavior which arises due to
the swimming motion of the particles, and show that there are two basic
mechanisms responsible for this phenomena: the hydrodynamic interactions caused
by the squirming motion of the particles, and the particle-particle collisions.
This dual nature gives rise to two distinct time- and length- scales, and thus
to two diffusion coefficients, which we obtain by a suitable analysis of the
swimming motion. We show that the collisions between swimmers can be
interpreted in terms of binary collisions, in which the effective collision
radius is reduced due to the collision dynamics of swimming particles in
viscous fluids. At short time-scales, the dynamics of the swimmer is analogous
to that of an inert tracer particle in a swimming suspension, in which the
diffusive motion is caused by fluid-particle collisions. Our results, along
with the simulation method we have introduced, will allow us to gain a better
understanding of the complex hydrodynamic interactions of self-propelled

particle supporting the internal ""spin motion"" or $\textit{Zitterbewegung}$ and
a particle as concentrated energy. First, the particle moves randomly in a
limited area (in a quantum sized-volume) like random vibrating system where the
particle will diffuse in a quantum-sized volume when it absorbs or emits the
quantized amount of energy. The quantum sized-volume can move too and plays
role similar to the carrier amplitude, while the vibrational motion of the
fundamental particle with frequency and amplitude represents a modulating
signal. The current of diffusion process taking place in the quantum
sized-volume will represent the emergence of a spin phenomenon shown by the
existence of Clifford algebra. Second, the particle is pure energy concentrated
on the surface of 3 dimensional sphere-form (2-manifold without boundary).

Interference of Identical Particles from Entanglement to Boson-Sampling,http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4266v2,['Malte C. Tichy'],"  Progress in the reliable preparation, coherent propagation and efficient
detection of many-body states has recently brought collective quantum phenomena
of many identical particles into the spotlight. This tutorial introduces the
physics of many-boson and many-fermion interference required for the
description of current experiments and for the understanding of novel
approaches to quantum computing.
  The field is motivated via the two-particle case, for which the uncorrelated,
classical dynamics of distinguishable particles is compared to the quantum
behaviour of identical bosons and fermions. Bunching of bosons is opposed to
anti-bunching of fermions, while both species constitute equivalent sources of
bipartite two-level entanglement. The realms of indistinguishable and
distinguishable particles are connected by a monotonic transition, on a scale
defined by the coherence length of the interfering particles.
  As we move to larger systems, any attempt to understand many particles via
the two-particle paradigm fails: In contrast to two-particle bunching and
anti-bunching, the very same signatures can be exhibited by bosons and
fermions, and coherent effects dominate over statistical behaviour. The
simulation of many-boson interference, termed Boson-Sampling, entails a
qualitatively superior computational complexity when compared to fermions. The
hierarchy between bosons and fermions also characterises multipartite
entanglement generation, for which bosons again clearly outmatch fermions.
Finally, the quantum-to-classical transition between many indistinguishable and
many distinguishable particles features non-monotonic structures. While the
same physical principles govern small and large systems, the deployment of the
intrinsic complexity of collective many-body interference makes more particles
behave differently.

equal-size particles (Pan and Padoan, Paper I) to particles of arbitrarily
different sizes. The Pan and Padoan (PP10) model shows that the relative
velocity between different particles has two contributions, named the
generalized shear and acceleration terms, respectively. The generalized shear
term represents the particles' memory of the spatial flow velocity difference
across the particle distance in the past, while the acceleration term is
associated with the temporal flow velocity difference on individual particle
trajectories. Using the simulation of Paper I, we compute the root-mean-square
relative velocity, <w^2>^1/2, as a function of the friction times, tau_p1 and
tau_p2, of the two particles, and show that the PP10 prediction is in
satisfactory agreement with the data, confirming its physical picture. For a
given tau_p1 below the Lagrangian correlation time of the flow, T_L, <w^2>^1/2
as a function of tau_p2 shows a dip at tau_p2~tau_p1, indicating tighter
velocity correlation between similar particles. Defining a ratio
f=tau_pl/tau_ph, with tau_pl and tau_ph the friction times of the smaller and
larger particles, we find that <w^2>^1/2 increases with decreasing f due to the
generalized acceleration contribution, which dominates at f<1/4. At a fixed f,
our model predicts that <w^2>^1/2 scales as tau_ph^1/2 for tau_p,h in the
inertial range of the flow, stays roughly constant for T_L <tau_ph < T_L/f, and
finally decreases as tau_ph^-1/2 for tau_ph>>T_L/f. The acceleration term is
independent of the particle distance, r, and thus reduces the r-dependence of

A contact model for sticking of adhesive meso-particles,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03720v2,"['Abhinendra Singh', 'Vanessa Magnanimo', 'Stefan Luding']","  The interaction between visco-elasto-plastic and adhesive particles is the
subject of this study, where ""meso-particles"" are introduced, i.e., simplified
particles, whose contact mechanics is not taken into account in all details. A
few examples of meso-particles include agglomerates or groups of primary
particles, or inhomogeneous particles with micro-structures of the scale of the
contact deformation, such as core-shell materials. A simple, flexible contact
model for meso-particles is proposed, which allows to model the bulk behavior
of assemblies of many particles in both rapid and slow, quasi-static flow
situations. An attempt is made to categorize existing contact models for the
normal force, discuss all the essential mechanical ingredients that must enter
the model (qualitatively) and finally solve it analytically. The model combines
a short-ranged, non-contact part (resembling either dry or wet materials) with
an elaborate, visco-elasto-plastic and adhesive contact law. Using energy
conservation arguments, an analytical expression for the coefficient of
restitution is derived in terms of the impact velocity (for pair interactions
or, equivalently, without loss of generality, for quasi-static situations in
terms of the maximum overlap or confining stress). Adhesive particles (or
meso-particles) stick to each other at very low impact velocity, while they
rebound less dissipatively with increasing velocity, in agreement with previous
studies. For even higher impact velocities an interesting second sticking and
rebound regime is reported. The low velocity sticking is due to non-contact
adhesive forces, the first rebound regime is due to stronger elastic and
kinetic energies with little dissipation, while the high velocity sticking is
generated by the non-linearly increasing, history dependent plastic dissipation
and adhesive contact force.

"Phase transitions in the distribution of inelastically colliding
  inertial particles",http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04190v2,"['Sergey Belan', 'Alexander Chernykh', 'Gregory Falkovich']","  It was recently suggested that the sign of particle drift in inhomogeneous
temperature or turbulence depends on the particle inertia: weakly inertial
particles localize near minima of temperature or turbulence intensity (effects
known as thermophoresis and turbophoresis), while strongly inertial particles
fly away from minima in an unbounded space. The problem of a particle near
minima of turbulence intensity is related to that of two particles in a random
flow, so that the localization-delocalization transition in the former
corresponds to the path-coalescence transition in the latter. The transition is
signaled by the sign change of the Lyapunov exponent that characterizes the
mean rate of particle approach to the minimum (which could be wall or another
particle). Here we solve analytically this problem for inelastic collisions and
derive the phase diagram for the transition in the inertia-inelasticity plane.
An important feature of the phase diagram is the region of inelastic collapse:
if the restitution coefficient of particle velocity is smaller than some
critical value, then the particle is localized for any inertia. We present
direct numerical simulations which support the theory and in addition reveal
the dependence of the transition of the flow correlation time, characterized by
the Stokes number.

Particle Control in Phase Space by Global K-Means Clustering,http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.03849v2,"['J. Trier Frederiksen', 'G. Lapenta', 'M. E. Pessah']","  We devise and explore an iterative optimization procedure for controlling
particle populations in particle-in-cell (PIC) codes via merging and splitting
of computational macro-particles. Our approach, is to compute an optimal
representation of the global particle phase space structure while decreasing or
increasing the entire particle population, based on k-means clustering of the
data. In essence the procedure amounts to merging or splitting particles by
statistical means, throughout the entire simulation volume in question, while
minimizing a 6-dimensional total distance measure to preserve the physics.
Particle merging is by far the most demanding procedure when considering
conservation laws of physics; it amounts to lossy compression of particle phase
space data. We demonstrate that our k-means approach conserves energy and
momentum to high accuracy, even for high compression ratios, $\mathcal{R}
\approx 3$ --- \emph{i.e.}, $N_{f} \lesssim 0.33N_{i}$. Interestingly, we find
that an accurate particle splitting step can be performed using k-means as
well; this from an argument of symmetry. The split solution, using k-means,
places splitted particles optimally, to obtain maximal spanning on the phase
space manifold. Implementation and testing is done using an electromagnetic PIC
code, the \ppcode. Nonetheless, the k-means framework is general; it is not
limited to Vlasov-Maxwell type PIC codes. We discuss advantages and drawbacks
of this optimal phase space reconstruction.

  resuspension into turbulent flow",http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00879v2,"['Hadar Traugott', 'Alex Liberzon']","  Turbulent resuspension, a process of lifting solid particles from the bottom
by turbulent flow, is ubiquitous in environmental and industrial applications.
The process is a sequence of events that start with an incipient motion of the
particle being dislodged from its place, continue as sliding or rolling on the
surface, ending with the particle being detached from the surface and lifted up
into the flow. In this study the focus is on the resuspension of solid
spherical particles with the density comparable to that of the fluid and the
diameter comparable with the Kolmogorov length scale. We track their motion
during the lift-off events in an oscillating grid turbulent flow. We measure
simultaneously the Lagrangian trajectories of both the particles freely moving
along the bottom smooth wall and the surrounding flow tracers. Different force
terms acting on particles were estimated based on particle motion and local
flow parameters. The results show that: \emph{i}) the lift force is dominant;
\emph{ii}) drag force on freely moving particles is less relevant in this type
of resuspension; \emph{iii}) the Basset (history or viscous-unsteady) force is
a non-negligible component and plays an important role before the lift-off
event. Although we cannot estimate very accurately the magnitude of the force
terms, we find that during the resuspension they are within the range of
$2\div10$ times the buoyancy force magnitude. The findings cannot be
extrapolated to particles, which are much smaller than the Kolmogorov length
scale, or much denser than the fluid. Nevertheless, the present findings can
assist in modeling of the sediment transport, particle filtration, pneumatic
conveying and mixing in bio-reactors.

magnetically bound vorton pairs, briefly introduced here, predicts the
existence of a complete family of magnetically charged particles, as well as
their neutral isotopic partners (all counterparts to the SM elementary
particles), in which the lowest mass (charged) particle would be an
electrically neutral stable lepton, but which carries a magnetic charge
equivalent to 1e. This new particle, which we call a magneticon (a counterpart
to the electron) would be pair produced at all e+e- colliders at an Ecm above
twice its mass. In addition, PP and PPbar colliders should also be able to
produce these new particles through the Drell-Yan process. To our knowledge, no
monopole search experiment has been sensitive to such a low-charged magnetic
monopole above a particle mass of about 5 GeV/c2. Hence, we propose that a
search for such a stable particle of magnetic charge 1e should be undertaken.
We have taken the ATLAS detector at the LHC as an example in which this search
might be done. To this end, we have modeled the magnetic fields and muon
trigger chambers of this detector. We show results from a simple Monte Carlo

slit as a function of the separation of the symmetrically charged confining
surfaces. A dedicated setup called the nano-fluidic confinement apparatus (NCA)
allows us to parallelize the two confining surfaces and to continuously
approach them down to direct contact. Interferometric scattering (iSCAT)
detection is used to measure the particle contrast with 2 ms temporal
resolution. We obtain the confinement gap distance from the interference signal
of the glass and the oxide-covered silicon wafer surface with nanometer
accuracy. We present a three parameter model that describes the optical signal
of the particles as a function of particle height and gap distance. The model
is verified using nanoparticles immobilized at the glass and the substrate
surface. For freely diffusing particles, the envelope of the particle signal as
a function of gap distance and the known particle height at tight confinement
is used to calibrate the particle signal in-situ and obtain all free model
parameters. Due to the periodic contrast variation for large gap distances we
obtain a set of possible particle heights for a given contrast value. For a
range of small gap distances this assignment is unique and the particle height
can be measured directly with high accuracy. The high temporal resolution
allows us to measure the height occupation probability which provides a direct
link to the free energy landscape the particles are probing via the Boltzmann
distribution. Accordingly by fitting the results to a physical model based on
the linear superposition approximation (LSA), the physical parameters governing

resonances in periodically patterned magnetic films for the detection of
adsorbed magnetic particles with diameters ranging from 6 nm to 4 $\mu$m. The
nanopatterned films contain arrays of holes which can act as preferential
adsorption sites for small particles. Hole-localized particles act in unison to
shift the resonant frequencies of the various modes of the patterned layer with
shift polarities determined by the localization of each mode within the
nanopattern's repeating unit cell. The same polarity shifts are observed for a
large range of coverages, even when hole-localized particles are covered by
quasi-continuous particle sheets. For large particles however, preferential
adsorption no longer occurs, leading to resonance shifts with polarities which
are independent of the mode localization. Analogous shifts are seen in
continuous layers where, for small particles, the shift of the layer's
fundamental mode is typically about 10 times less than in patterned systems and
induced by relatively weak fields emanating beyond the particle in the

bind and engulf particles by their cell membrane. Particle engulfment involves
particle recognition by cell-surface receptors, signaling and remodeling of the
actin cytoskeleton to guide the membrane around the particle in a zipper-like
fashion. Despite the signaling complexity, phagocytosis also depends strongly
on biophysical parameters, such as particle shape, and the need for
actin-driven force generation remains poorly understood. Here, we propose a
novel, three-dimensional and stochastic biophysical model of phagocytosis, and
study the engulfment of particles of various sizes and shapes, including spiral
and rod-shaped particles reminiscent of bacteria. Highly curved shapes are not
taken up, in line with recent experimental results. Furthermore, we
surprisingly find that even without actin-driven force generation, engulfment
proceeds in a large regime of parameter values, albeit more slowly and with
highly variable phagocytic cups. We experimentally confirm these predictions
using fibroblasts, transfected with immunoreceptor FcyRIIa for engulfment of
immunoglobulin G-opsonized particles. Specifically, we compare the wild-type
receptor with a mutant receptor, unable to signal to the actin cytoskeleton.
Based on the reconstruction of phagocytic cups from imaging data, we indeed
show that cells are able to engulf small particles even without support from
biological actin-driven processes. This suggests that biochemical pathways
render the evolutionary ancient process of phagocytic highly robust, allowing
cells to engulf even very large particles. The particle-shape dependence of
phagocytosis makes a systematic investigation of host-pathogen interactions and
an efficient design of a vehicle for drug delivery possible.

conditions for global survival, local survival and infinite activation both in
the case where all particles are immortal and in the case where particles have
geometrically distributed lifespan (with parameter depending on the starting

automatically adjusted by the changing weights of the particles. This paper

red and blue particles perform independent nearest-neighbor continuous-time
symmetric random walks on the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}$ with jump rates
$D_R$ for red particles and $D_B$ for blue particles, the interaction rule
being that blue particles turn red upon contact with a red particle. The
initial condition consists of i.i.d. Poisson particle numbers at each site,
with particles at the left of the origin being red, while particles at the
right of the origin are blue. We are interested in the dynamics of the front,
defined as the rightmost position of a red particle. For the case $D_R=D_B$,
Kesten and Sidoravicius established that the front moves ballistically, and
more precisely that it satisfies a law of large numbers. Their proof is based
on a multi-scale renormalization technique, combined with approximate
sub-additivity arguments. In this paper, we build a renewal structure for the
front propagation process, and as a corollary we obtain a central limit theorem
for the front when $D_R=D_B$. Moreover, this result can be extended to the case
where $D_R>D_B$, up to modifying the dynamics so that blue particles turn red
upon contact with a site that has previously been occupied by a red particle.
Our approach extends the renewal structure approach developed by Comets,

balances the weights of the particles. The excess energy of the surface of the
deformed gel causes them to attract as is the case with the generic capillary
interactions of particles on a liquid surface. The variation of the
gravitational potential energies of the particles resulting from their descents
in the gel coupled with the superposition principle of Nicolson allow a fair
estimation of the distance dependent attractive energy of the particles. This
energy follows a modified Bessel function of the second kind with a
characteristic elastocapillary decay length that decreases with the elasticity
of the medium. An interesting finding of this study is that the particles on
the gel move towards each other as if the system possesses a negative
diffusivity that is inversely proportional to friction. This study illustrates
how the capillary interaction of particles is modified by the elasticity of the

driven self-assembly of particles. In particular, this study points out that
the range and the strength of the capillary interaction can be tuned in by
appropriate choices of the elasticity of the support and the interfacial

particles in triply-periodic domains has been performed under dilute
conditions. For a single solid-to-fluid density ratio of 1.5 we have considered
two values of the Galileo number corresponding to steady vertical motion
(Ga=121) and to steady oblique motion (Ga=178) in the case of one isolated
sphere. For the multi-particle system we observe strong particle clustering
only in the latter case. The geometry and time scales related to clustering are
determined from Voronoi tesselation and particle-conditioned averaging. As a
consequence of clustering, the average particle settling velocity is increased
by 12% as compared to the value of an isolated sphere; such a collective effect
is not observed in the non-clustering case. By defining a local (instantaneous)
fluid velocity average in the vicinity of the finite-size particles it is shown
that the observed enhancement of the settling velocity is due to the fact that
the downward fluid motion (with respect to the global average) which is induced
in the cluster regions is preferentially sampled by the particles. It is
further observed that the variance of the particle velocity is strongly
enhanced in the clustering case. With the aid of a decomposition of the
particle velocity it is shown that this increase is due to enhanced fluid
velocity fluctuations (due to clustering) in the vicinity of the particles.
Finally, we discuss a possible explanation for the observation of a critical
Galileo number marking the onset of clustering under dilute conditions.

parallel alignment with respect to the far field nematic, whereas the

procedures for consistent inference is the class of approximations termed
particle filters or sequential Monte Carlo methods. However, in high
dimensions, standard particle filters (e.g. the bootstrap particle filter) can
have a cost that is exponential in $d$ for the algorithm to be stable in an
appropriate sense. We develop a new particle filter, called the
\emph{space-time particle filter}, for a specific family of state-space models
in discrete time. This new class of particle filters provide consistent Monte
Carlo estimates for any fixed $d$, as do standard particle filters. Moreover,
we expect that the state-space particle filter will scale much better with $d$
than the standard filter. We illustrate this analytically for a model of a

space-direction, when we show that the algorithm exhibits certain stability
properties as $d$ increases at a cost $\mathcal{O}(nNd^2)$, where $n$ is the
time parameter and $N$ is the number of Monte Carlo samples, that are fixed and
independent of $d$. Similar results are expected to hold, under a more general

shock, mediating their acceleration. In contrast, in strongly magnetized
quasi-perpendicular shocks, the efficiencies of both particle acceleration and
magnetic field generation are suppressed. Particle acceleration, when
efficient, modifies the turbulence around the shock on a long time scale, and
the accelerated particles have a characteristic energy spectral index of ~ 2.2
in the ultra-relativistic limit. We discuss how this novel understanding of
particle acceleration and magnetic field generation in relativistic shocks can
be applied to high-energy astrophysical phenomena, with an emphasis on PWNe and
GRB afterglows.

  particles from laser diffraction measurements",http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03455v3,"['Okpeafoh S. Agimelen', 'Anthony J. Mulholland', 'Jan Sefcik']","  Manufacturing of particulate products across many industries relies on
accurate measurements of particle size distributions in dispersions or powders.
Laser diffraction (or small angle light scattering) is commonly used, usually
off-line, for particle size measurements. The estimation of particle sizes by
this method requires the solution of an inverse problem using a suitable
scattering model that takes into account size, shape and optical properties of
the particles. However, laser diffraction instruments are usually accompanied
by software that employs a default scattering model for spherical particles,
which is then used to solve the inverse problem even though a significant
number of particulate products occur in strongly non-spherical shapes such as
needles. In this work, we demonstrate that using the spherical model for the
estimation of sizes of needle-like particles can lead to the appearance of
artefacts in the form of multimodal populations of particles with size modes
much smaller than those actually present in the sample. This effect can result
in a significant under-estimation of the mean particle size and in false modes
in estimated particles size distributions.

Key-Lock Colloids in a Nematic Liquid Crystal,http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07714v1,"['Nuno M. Silvestre', 'M. Tasinkevych']","  The Landau-de Gennes free energy is used to study theoretically the effective
interaction of a spherical ""key"" and an anisotropic ""lock"" colloidal particles.
We assume identical anchoring properties of the surfaces of the key and of the
lock particles, and consider planar degenerate and perpendicular anchoring
conditions separately. {The lock particle is modeled} as a spherical particle
with a spherical dimple. When such a particle is introduced into a nematic
liquid crystal, it orients its dimple at an oblique angle $\theta_{eq}$ with
respect to the far field director ${\bf n}_{\infty}$. This angle depends on the
depth of the dimple. Minimization results show that the free energy of a pair
of key and lock particles exhibits a global minimum for the configuration when
the key particle is facing the dimple of the lock colloidal particle. The
preferred orientation $\phi_{eq}$ of the key-lock composite doublet relative to
${\bf n}_{\infty}$ is robust against thermal fluctuations. The preferred
orientation $\theta_{eq}^{(2)}$ of the dimple particle in the doublet is
different from the isolated situation. {This is related to the ""direct""

an important role in self-organization and clustering of mixtures of colloidal

magnetically dominated proton-electron plasmas. Reconnection is driven by
large-scale magnetic stresses in interacting current-carrying flux tubes. Our
model relies on development of current-driven instabilities on macroscopic
scales. These tilt-kink instabilities develop in an initially force-free
equilibrium of repelling current channels. Using MHD methods we study a 3D
model of repelling and interacting flux tubes in which we simultaneously evolve
test particles, guided by electromagnetic fields obtained from MHD. We identify
two stages of particle acceleration; Initially particles accelerate in the
current channels, after which the flux ropes start tilting and kinking and
particles accelerate due to reconnection processes in the plasma. The explosive
stage of reconnection produces non-thermal energy distributions with slopes
that depend on plasma resistivity and the initial particle velocity. We also
discuss the influence of the length of the flux ropes on particle acceleration
and energy distributions. This study extends previous 2.5D results to 3D
setups, providing all ingredients needed to model realistic scenarios like
solar flares, black hole flares and particle acceleration in pulsar wind
nebulae: formation of strong resistive electric fields, explosive reconnection
and non-thermal particle distributions. By assuming initial energy
equipartition between electrons and protons, applying low resistivity in
accordance with solar corona conditions and limiting the flux rope length to a
fraction of a solar radius we obtain realistic energy distributions for solar
flares with non-thermal power law tails and maximum electron energies up to 11

Scattering Amplitudes For All Masses and Spins,http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04891v1,"['Nima Arkani-Hamed', 'Tzu-Chen Huang', 'Yu-tin Huang']","  We introduce a formalism for describing four-dimensional scattering
amplitudes for particles of any mass and spin. This naturally extends the
familiar spinor-helicity formalism for massless particles to one where these
variables carry an extra SU(2) little group index for massive particles, with
the amplitudes for spin S particles transforming as symmetric rank 2S tensors.
We systematically characterise all possible three particle amplitudes
compatible with Poincare symmetry. Unitarity, in the form of consistent
factorization, imposes algebraic conditions that can be used to construct all
possible four-particle tree amplitudes. This also gives us a convenient basis
in which to expand all possible four-particle amplitudes in terms of what can
be called ""spinning polynomials"". Many general results of quantum field theory
follow the analysis of four-particle scattering, ranging from the set of all
possible consistent theories for massless particles, to spin-statistics, and
the Weinberg-Witten theorem. We also find a transparent understanding for why
massive particles of sufficiently high spin can not be ""elementary"". The Higgs
and Super-Higgs mechanisms are naturally discovered as an infrared unification
of many disparate helicity amplitudes into a smaller number of massive
amplitudes, with a simple understanding for why this can't be extended to
Higgsing for gravitons. We illustrate a number of applications of the formalism
at one-loop, giving few-line computations of the electron (g-2) as well as the
beta function and rational terms in QCD. ""Off-shell"" observables like
correlation functions and form-factors can be thought of as scattering
amplitudes with external ""probe"" particles of general mass and spin, so all

A Modification of Particle Swarm Optimization using Random Walk,http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10401v2,"['Rajesh Misra', 'Kumar S. Ray']","  Particle swarm optimization comes under lot of changes after James Kennedy
and Russell Eberhart first proposes the idea in 1995. The changes has been done
mainly on Inertia parameters in velocity updating equation so that the
convergence rate will be higher. We are proposing a novel approach where
particles movement will not be depend on its velocity rather it will be decided
by constrained biased random walk of particles. In random walk every particles
movement based on two significant parameters, one is random process like toss
of a coin and other is how much displacement a particle should have. In our
approach we exploit this idea by performing a biased random operation and based
on the outcome of that random operation, PSO particles choose the direction of
the path and move non-uniformly into the solution space. This constrained,
non-uniform movement helps the random walking particle to converge quicker then
classical PSO. In our constrained biased random walking approach, we no longer
needed velocity term (Vi), rather we introduce a new parameter (K) which is a
probabilistic function. No global best particle (PGbest), local best particle
(PLbest), Constriction parameter (W) are required rather we use a new term
called Ptarg which is loosely influenced by PGbest.We test our algorithm on
five different benchmark functions, and also compare its performance with
classical PSO and Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO).This new approach
have been shown significantly better than basic PSO and sometime outperform
QPSO in terms of convergence, search space, number of iterations.

trinaphthylene molecules, on a triangular lattice interacting exclusively
through excluded volume interactions. Each particle consists of a central site
and three of its six nearest neighbours chosen alternately, such that there are
two types of particles which are mirror images of each other. We study the
equilibrium properties of the system using grand canonical Monte Carlo
simulations that implements an algorithm with cluster moves that is able to
equilibrate the system at densities close to full packing. We show that, with
increasing density, the system undergoes two entropy-driven phase transitions
with two broken-symmetry phases. At low densities, the system is in a
disordered phase. As intermediate phases, there is a solid-like sublattice
phase in which one type of particle is preferred over the other and the
particles preferentially occupy one of four sublattices, thus breaking both
particle-symmetry as well as translational invariance. At even higher
densities, the phase is a columnar phase, where the particle-symmetry is
restored, and the particles preferentially occupy even or odd rows along one of
the three directions. This phase has translational order in only one direction,
and breaks rotational invariance. From finite size scaling, we demonstrate that
both the transitions are first order in nature. We also show that the simpler

volume of fluid, which has been seeded with tracer particles and observed from
multiple camera viewpoints. The first step of 3D-PIV is to reconstruct the 3D
locations of the tracer particles from synchronous views of the volume. We
propose a new method for iterative particle reconstruction (IPR), in which the
locations and intensities of all particles are inferred in one joint energy
minimization. The energy function is designed to penalize deviations between
the reconstructed 3D particles and the image evidence, while at the same time
aiming for a sparse set of particles. We find that the new method, without any
post-processing, achieves significantly cleaner particle volumes than a
conventional, tomographic MART reconstruction, and can handle a wide range of
particle densities. The second step of 3D-PIV is to then recover the dense
motion field from two consecutive particle reconstructions. We propose a
variational model, which makes it possible to directly include physical
properties, such as incompressibility and viscosity, in the estimation of the
motion field. To further exploit the sparse nature of the input data, we
propose a novel, compact descriptor of the local particle layout. Hence, we
avoid the memory-intensive storage of high-resolution intensity volumes. Our
framework is generic and allows for a variety of different data costs

both the sum of squared differences (SSD) and the normalized cross-correlation

importance for delicately tailoring thermal properties. Combining phonon
particle and wave effects through different strategies, previous studies have
obtained ultra-low thermal conductivity in nanostructures. However, phonon
particle and wave effects are coupled together, that is their individual
contributions to phonon transport cannot be figured out. Here, we present how
to quantify the particle and wave effects on phonon transport by combining
Monte Carlo and atomic green function methods. We apply it to 1D silicon
nanophononic metamaterial with cross-junctions, where it has been thought that
the wave effect was the main modulator to block phonon transport and the
particle effect was negligibly weak. Surprisingly, we find that the particle
effect is quite significant as well and can contribute as much as 39% to the
total thermal conductivity reduction. Moreover, the particle effect does not
decrease much as the cross section area (CSA) of the structure decreases and
still keeps quite strong even for CSA as small as 2.23 nm2. Further phonon
transmission analysis by reducing the junction leg length also qualitatively
demonstrates the strong particle effect. The results highlight the importance
of mutually controlling particle and wave characteristics, and the
methodologies for quantifying phonon particle and wave effect are important for

Discrete-to-continuum limits of particles with an annihilation rule,http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11199v2,"['Patrick van Meurs', 'Marco Morandotti']","  In the recent trend of extending discrete-to-continuum limit passages for
gradient flows of single-species particle systems with singular and nonlocal
interactions to particles of opposite sign, any annihilation effect of
particles with opposite sign has been side-stepped. We present the first
rigorous discrete-to-continuum limit passage which includes annihilation. This
result paves the way to applications such as vortices, charged particles, and
dislocations. In more detail, the discrete setting of our discrete-to-continuum
limit passage is given by particles on the real line. Particles of the same
type interact by a singular interaction kernel; those of opposite sign interact
by a regular one. If two particles of opposite sign collide, they annihilate,
i.e., they are taken out of the system. The challenge for proving a
discrete-to-continuum limit is that annihilation is an intrinsically discrete
effect where particles vanish instantaneously in time, while on the continuum
scale the mass of the particle density decays continuously in time. The proof
contains two novelties: (i) the observation that empirical measures of the
discrete dynamics (with annihilation rule) satisfy the continuum evolution
equation that only implicitly encodes annihilation, and (ii) the fact that, by
imposing a relatively mild separation assumption on the initial data, we can
identify the limiting particle density as a solution to the same continuum
evolution equation.

to solve the problem of calculating electrostatic interactions in a system
composed by many dielectric particles, embedded in a homogeneous dielectric
medium, which in turn can also be permeated by charge carriers. The system is
defined by the charge, size, position and dielectric constant of each particle,
as well as the dielectric constant and Debye length of the medium. The effects
of taking into account the dielectric nature of the particles is explored in
selected scenarios where the presence of electrolytes in the medium can
significantly influence the total undergoing interactions. Description of the
mutual interactions between all particles in the system as being truly of
many-body nature reveals how such effects can effectively influence the
magnitudes and even directions of the resulting forces, especially those acting
on particles that have a null net charge. Particular attention is given to a
situation that can be related to colloidal particles in an electrolyte
solution, where it's shown that polarization effects alone can substantially
raise or lower---depending on the dielectric contrast between the particles and
the medium---the energy barrier that divides particle coagulation and
flocculation regions, when an interplay between electrostatic and additional
van der Waals forces is considered. Overall, the results suggest that for an

consider particle polarization if the separation between the interacting

"Persistence and Nonpersistence as Complementary Models of Identical
  Quantum Particles",http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.13254v1,['Philip Goyal'],"  According to our understanding of the everyday physical world, observable
phenomena are underpinned by persistent objects that can be reidentified (or
tracked) across time by observation of their distinctive properties. This
understanding is reflected in classical mechanics, which posits that matter
consists of persistent, reidentifiable particles. However, the mathematical
symmetrization procedures used to describe identical particles within the
quantum formalism have led to the widespread belief that identical quantum
particles lack either persistence or reidentifiability. However, it has proved
difficult to reconcile these assertions with the fact that identical particles
are routinely assumed to be reidentifiable in particular circumstances.
  Moreover, neither of these assertions accounts for the mathematical form of
the symmetrization procedures used to describe identical particles within the
quantum framework, leaving open theoretical possibilities other than bosonic
and fermionic behavior, such as paraparticles, which do not appear to be
realized in nature. Here we propose the novel idea that both persistence and
nonpersistence models must be employed in order to fully account for the
behaviour of identical particles. Thus, identical particles are neither
persistent nor nonpersistent. We prove the viability of this viewpoint by
showing how Feynman's and Dirac's symmetrization procedures arise through a
synthesis of a quantum treatment of these models, and by showing how
reidentifiability emerges in a context-dependent manner. We further show that
the persistence and nonpersistence models satisfy the key characteristics of
Bohr's concept of complementarity, and thereby propose that the behavior of
identical particles is a manifestation of a persistence-nonpersistence
complementarity, analogous to Bohr's wave-particle complementarity for
individual particles.

multiscale dynamics in UGKS is achieved through the coupled particle transport
and collision in the particle evolution process within a time step. In this
paper, under the UGKS framework, we propose an efficient multiscale unified
gas-kinetic wave-particle (UGKWP) method. The gas dynamics in UGKWP method is
described by the individual particle movement coupled with the evolution of the
probability density function (PDF). During a time step, the trajectories of
simulation particles are tracked until collision happens, and the
post-collision particles are evolved collectively through the evolution of the
corresponding distribution function. The evolution of simulation particles and
distribution function is guided by evolution of macroscopic variables. The two
descriptions on a gas particle, i.e. wave and particle, switch dynamically with
time. A new concept of multiscale multi-efficiency preserving (MMP) method is
introduced, and the UGKWP method is shown to be an MMP scheme. The UGKWP method
is specially efficient for hypersonic flow simulation in all regimes in
comparison with the wave-type discrete ordinate methods, and presents a much
lower stochastic noise in the continuum flow regime in comparison with the

is the existence and location of stable equilibria within the cross-sectional

the hydrodynamic forces acting on a particle. A leading order model of the
forces within the cross-sectional plane is obtained through the use of a

Reynolds number of the disturbance flow. We predict the behaviour of neutrally
buoyant particles at low flow rates and examine the variation in focusing
position with respect to particle size and bend radius, independent of the flow
rate. In this regime, the lateral focusing position of particles approximately
collapses with respect to a dimensionless parameter dependent on three length

Two parameters consider the mutual orientations of particles (the orientation
tensor eigenvalues $S_1$ and $S_2$) and two angles represent the flow direction

that the hydrodynamic forces on the particles are independent of the mutual
particle orientations. Rather, the most important parameter representing the

both the viscous and inertial regimes. Similarly, we observe that the average
lift for a multiparticle system follows sine-cosine scaling, as is observed for
isolated particles. Such findings are very helpful since the pressure drop of a
packed bed or porous media can be computed just with the knowledge of
orientation distribution of particles and their drag at $\phi=0^\circ$ and

that factorial moments of a system with $n$ particles are linked to those of a

particle systems with absorption are often dual to boundary-driven
non-equilibrium systems, the consistency property implies recurrence relations
for expectations of correlations in non-equilibrium steady states. We
illustrate these relations with several examples.

Local and global force balance for diffusiophoretic transport,http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13901v1,"['Sophie Marbach', 'Hiroaki Yoshida', 'Lydéric Bocquet']","  Electro- and diffusio- phoresis of particles correspond respectively to the
transport of particles under electric field and solute concentration gradients.
Such interfacial transport phenomena take their origin in a diffuse layer close
to the particle surface, and the motion of the particle is force-free. In the
case of electrophoresis, it is further expected that the stress acting on the
moving particle vanishes locally as a consequence of local electroneutrality.
But the argument does not apply to diffusiophoresis, which takes its origin in
solute concentration gradients. In this paper we investigate further the local
and global force balance on a particle undergoing diffusiophoresis. We
calculate the local tension applied on the particle surface and show that,
counter-intuitively, the local force on the particle does not vanish for
diffusiophoresis, in spite of the global force being zero as expected.
Incidentally, our description allows to clarify the osmotic balance in
diffusiophoresis, which has been a source of debates in the recent years. We
explore various cases, including hard and soft interactions, as well as porous
particles, and provide analytic predictions for the local force balance in
these various systems. The existence of local stresses may induce deformation
of soft particles undergoing diffusiophoresis, hence suggesting applications in
terms of particle separation based on capillary diffusiophoresis.

"General Defocusing Particle Tracking: Fundamentals and uncertainty
  assessment",http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01669v1,"['Rune Barnkob', 'Massimiliano Rossi']","  General Defocusing Particle Tracking (GDPT) refers to a class of
three-dimensional particle tracking methods that use a single-camera view and
determine the particle depth positions from the defocusing patterns of the
corresponding particle images. Its distinctive feature is to access particles'
depth coordinates through a direct comparison of the particle images with a set
of reference particle images at known depth positions. Many implementations of
GDPT are possible, especially with respect to how to compare target and
calibration images, how to deal with overlapping particle images, and how to
optimize the computational time. The emergence of new and more sophisticated
GDPT approaches requires the definition of the method fundamentals as well as a
standardized framework for the objective assessment of the method performance
and applicability. To meet this need, we identify and describe the fundamental
concepts and parameters defining GDPT. We define guidelines for a standardized
assessment of the efficiency and uncertainty of GDPT implementations. In
particular, we show that a complete GDPT assessment must state the obtained
particle detection rate, the depth coordinate uncertainty, and the measurement
depth. In addition, we provide datasets for the evaluation of a GDPT
implementation's dependency on image noise, particle image overlapping, and
light intensity variations. We used the presented datasets and guidelines to
assess the performance of DefocusTracker, a freely-accessible GDPT
implementation based on the normalized cross-correlation. The assessment of
DefocusTracker illustrates fundamental concepts of GDPT analysis and paves the
road as a first benchmark for further development of GDPT.

intrinsically different in the Epstein and Stokes regimes. We are also able to
study analytically the temporal evolution of a collection of particles with a

very-high-energy particles are accelerated there. The energy spectrum indicates
efficient acceleration of charged particles to energies beyond 100 TeV,

sentence. Particles can cooccur. Verbal arguments that could be identified by
particles can be eliminated in the Japanese sentence. And finally, in spoken
language particles are often omitted. A proper treatment of particles is thus
necessary to make an analysis of Japanese sentences possible. Our treatment is

hierarchy of particles motivated by their subcategorizational and

corrections to the number density of heavy particles (in thermal equilibrium

argue, however, that their definition of the number density does not correspond

model where the heavy particles carry a conserved U(1) charge, and the light
particles do not. The fluctuations of the net charge in a given volume then
provide a measure of the total number of heavy particles in that same volume.
We show that these charge fluctuations are Boltzmann suppressed (to all orders

Employing results from stochastic mechanics it is then shown that the combined

probability distribution for the position of the main particle is derived from
Schroedinger's equation. Furthermore it is shown that the main particle
distance traveled between collisions and the mean inter-collision time must
satisfy a type of Minkowski invariant. Hence if there is a correlation between
the pre- and post-collision velocities of the main particle through a collision
point then the mean distance traveled can be related to the mean inter-particle

approach can be applied to all elastic main particle/heatbath particle

"Clustering transition in a system of particles self-consistently driven
  by a shear flow",http://arxiv.org/abs/nlin/0409028v1,['Cristobal Lopez'],"  We introduce a simple model of active transport for an ensemble of particles
driven by an external shear flow. Active refers to the fact that the flow of
the particles is modified by the distribution of particles itself. The model
consists in that the effective velocity of every particle is given by the
average of the external flow velocities felt by the particles located at a
distance less than a typical radius, $R$. Numerical analysis reveals the
existence of a transition to clustering depending on the parameters of the
external flow and on $R$. A continuum description in terms of the number
density of particles is derived, and a linear stability analysis of the density
equation is performed in order to characterize the transitions observed in the
model of interacting particles.

having an extremely high quality factor. Typically, these arrays consist of
metal elements which have significantly high light absorption thus restricting
performance. In this paper we address the following question: can bound modes
be formed in dielectric systems where the absorption of light is negligible?
Our investigation of circular arrays of spherical particles shows that (1) high
quality modes in an array of 10 or more particles can be attained at least for
a refractive index $n_{r}>2$, so optical materials like TiO$_{2}$ or GaAs can
be used; (2) the most bound modes have nearly transverse polarization
perpendicular to the circular plane; (3) in a particularly interesting case of
TiO$_{2}$ particles (rutile phase, $n_{r}=2.7$), the quality factor of the most
bound mode increases almost by an order of magnitude with the addition of 10
extra particles, while for particles made of GaAs the quality factor increases
by almost two orders of magnitude with the addition of ten extra particles. We
hope that this preliminary study will stimulate experimental investigations of
bound modes in low-dimensional arrays of dielectric particles.

estimate the governing equation of fluctuations of microscopic space-time based
on the macroscopic law of motion. On this paper, the equivalence between the

micro/nano-particles in a magnetophoretic microsystem that consists of an array
of integrated soft-magnetic elements embedded beneath a microfluidic channel.
The elements, which are polarized by a bias field, produce a nonuniform field

analytical expressions for the dominant magnetic and fluidic forces. The
magnetic force is obtained using an analytical expression for the field

the magnetic response of particles. The theory takes into account particle size

Spatial Asymmetry For Particle Pairs And The Spin-Statistics Theorem,http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9809012v2,['Michael J. York'],"  We discuss the conditions under which identical particles may yet be
distinguishable and the relationship between particle permutation and exchange.
We show that we can always define permutation-symmetric state vectors. When the
particles are completely indistinguishable, then exchange is equivalent to
permutation and therefore the exchange eigenvalue for such
permutation-symmetric state vectors is always +1. Exchange asymmetry arises
when the particles are physically distinguishable, even though otherwise
identical, and can be computed from the transformations that arise when the
distinguishing features are reversed.
  There is a fundamental spatial asymmetry between the relative orientations of
any two vectors in a common frame of reference that persists even in the limit
that the vectors coincide. For a pair of particles this asymmetry between their
spin quantization frames renders them distinguishable even when otherwise
identical. In the conventional construction, this distinction is not properly
accounted for. Particle exchange is then equivalent to reversing this relative
orientation --- which requires a relative rotation by 2pi on the spin
quantization frame of one particle with respect to the other, thus resulting in
the conventional exchange phase.

Can the PVLAS particle be compatible with the astrophysical bounds?,http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.4329v1,['Javier Redondo'],"  The PVLAS collaboration has announced recently the observation dichroism and
birefringence of vacuum permeated by a intense magnetic field. Both are typical
predictions of the existence of light particles that, as the QCD axion,
interact with the electromagnetic field. The strength of the interaction as
inferred from the PVLAS measurements is however strongly excluded by
astrophysical arguments and axion Helioscopes since these particles, as
neutrinos, would be copiously produced in the interior of the Sun. In this
Thesis several refined models are presented where the astrophysical bounds are
severely relaxed, allowing the PVLAS particle interpretation. All these models
involve the existence of further new particles, in particular paraphotons and
millicharged particles. Also a model-independent study is performed, showing
that the reconciliation of the PVLAS particle interpretation implies new low
energy physics, usually accessible to precision experiments. Finally, if the
PVLAS particle would be parity even, the strongest exclusion bounds would come,
not from astrophysics, but from experiments searching for 5th type forces.

Nonlocal interactions in coagulating particle systems,http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.1246v1,"['T. H. M. Stein', 'S. V. Nazarenko']","  We consider a three dimensional system consisting of a large number of small

merging to similar sized particles (locality of interactions) or particles
dissimilar in size (nonlocality). We perform direct numerical simulations (DNS)
of this particle system and study the resulting mass spectra. In mean field
approximation, these systems can be described by the Smoluchowski coagulation
equation (SCE). DNS of the particle system with locality enforced show the
scaling solutions or Kolmogorov-Zakharov spectra for the SCE, signifying a
constant mass flux. DNS without a size ratio criterion show -4/3 scaling for
large particles in a system with gravity, signifying a constant flux in number
of particles, which we also find analytically by assuming nonlocality of
interactions in the SCE. For laminar shear, this nonlocality is only marginal,
and our DNS show that a correction to the scaling solution is required.

on the micro-universe and quantum state reduction concepts. The reduction of
the quantum state of a real particle is understood to take place objectively;
in every interaction event with other real particles, the quantum state of the

is localised in time and in space, with a maximum precision established by the
uncertainty principle. The minimum energy required for this localisation
constitutes the chief contribution to the particle mass. A further contribution
is provided by the self-interaction of the particle during localisation, which
occurs within a finite duration. Some algorithms for estimating these two
contributions are presented and discussed.

to one species of particles being expelled from that region, whilst the other
species is attracted into the region where the potential is applied. This
selectivity of one species of particle over the other in a localized region of

The origin of quantum nonlocality,http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0959v1,['Fang-Yu Hong'],"  Quantum entanglement is the quintessential characteristic of quantum
mechanics and the basis for quantum information processing. When one of two
maximally entangled particles is measured, without measurement the state of
another one is determined simultaneously no matter how far the two particles is
from each other. How can these phenomena take place since no object can move
faster than light speed in a vacuum? The key problem is due to the ignorance of
the interaction between a particle and a quantum vacuum. Just like the case
where a gun suffers recoil from its firing of a bullet, when a particle is
created from the quantum vacuum, the vacuum will be somewhat ""broken""
correspondingly, which can be described by a shadow state in the vacuum.
Through their shadows in the vacuum two quantum entangled particles can have a
distance-independent instantaneous interaction with each other. Quantum
teleportation, quantum swap, and wave function collapse are explained in a
similar way. Quantum object can be interpreted as a composite made up of a
particle and the shadowed quantum vacuum which is responsible for the wave
characteristic of the particle wave duality. The quantum vacuum is not only the
origin of all possible kinds of particles, but also the origin and the core of

Jet Reconstruction with Particle Flow in Heavy-Ion Collisions with CMS,http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0179v2,['Matthew Nguyen'],"  In the particle-flow approach information from all available sub-detector
systems is combined to reconstruct all stable particles. The global event
reconstruction has been shown to improve, in particular, the resolution of jet
energy and missing transverse energy in pp collisions compared to purely
calorimetric measurements. This improvement is achieved primarily by combining
the precise momentum determination of charged hadrons in the silicon tracker
with the associated energy depositions in the calorimeters. By resolving
individual particles inside jets, particle flow reduces the sensitivity of the
jet energy scale to the jet fragmentation pattern, which is known to be one of

Cascades of Particles Moving at Finite Velocity in Hyperbolic Spaces,http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.4904v1,"['Valentina Cammarota', 'Enzo Orsingher']","  A branching process of particles moving at finite velocity over the geodesic

times and deviates orthogonally when splitted. At time $t$, after $N(t)$
Poisson events, there are $N(t)+1$ particles moving along different geodesic

hyperbolic distance from two different and independent ways and we study the

of the parameters $c$ (hyperbolic velocity of motion) and $\lambda$ (rate of
reproduction). The mean hyperbolic distance of each moving particle is also
examined and a useful representation, as the distance of a randomly stopped

Phase segregation and transport in a two species multi-lane system,http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.5444v1,"['Sudipto Muhuri', 'Ignacio Pagonabarraga']","  We present a two channel driven lattice gas model with oppositely directed
species moving on two parallel lanes with lane switching processes. We study
correlated lane switching mechanism for particles so that switching may occur
with finite probability only when oppositely directed species meet on the same

number. For asymmetric particle exchange between the lanes, the system exhibits
unique polarization phenomenon with segregation of oppositely directed species
between the two lanes. The polarization phenomenon can be understood as a
consequence of existence of an absorbing steady state. For symmetric exchange
rate of particles between the lanes, the system remains unpolarized, with equal
particle density on both the lanes in the thermodynamic limit of large system
size. We study the system using a combination of a Mean Field(MF) analysis and
Monte Carlo simulations. The nature of phase segregation that we see for this

particle reservoir. The features observed for this minimal model will have
ramifications for biofilament based intracellular transport, wherein cellular

"Fluidic Electrodynamics: On parallels between electromagnetic and
  fluidic inertia",http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.4611v1,['Alexandre A. Martins'],"  The purpose of the present work is to trace parallels between the known
inertia forces in fluid dynamics with the inertia forces in electromagnetism
that are known to induce resistance forces on masses both due to acceleration
and at constant velocity. It is shown that the force exerted on a particle by
an ideal fluid produces two effects: i) resistance to acceleration and, ii) an
increase of mass with velocity. These resistance forces arise due to the fluid
dragged by the particle, where the bare mass of the particle at rest changes
when in motion (""dressed"" particle). It is demonstrated that the vector
potential created by a charged particle in motion acts as an ideal space flow
that surrounds the particle. The interaction between the particle and the
entrained space flow gives rise to the observed properties of inertia and the
relativistic increase of mass. Parallels are made between the inertia property
of matter, electromagnetism and the hydrodynamic drag in potential flow.
Accordingly, in this framework the non resistance of a particle in uniform
motion through an ideal fluid (D'Alembert's paradox) corresponds to Newton's
first law. The law of inertia suggests that the physical vacuum can be modeled
as an ideal fluid, agreeing with the space-time ideal fluid approach from
general relativity.

the continuity equation, the equation of particles current and the Maxwell
equations. This approximation does not require to include the evolution of
momentum and allows to consider physical problems. Certainly, particles current

monodisperse systems. Because of the dispersity in the particle size, the
systems investigated in this work do not crystallize and form disordered
cluster phases. The clustering transition appears as a smooth crossover to a
regime in which particles are mostly located in clusters, isolated particles
being infrequent. The analysis of the internal cluster structure reveals
microsegregation of the big and small particles, with a strong
homo-coordination in the binary mixture. Upon further lowering the temperature
below the clustering transition, the motion of the clusters' centers-of-mass
slows down dramatically, giving way to a cluster glass transition. In the
cluster glass, the diffusivities remain finite and display an activated
temperature dependence, indicating that relaxation in the cluster glass occurs
via particle hopping in a nearly arrested matrix of clusters. Finally we
discuss the influence of the microscopic dynamics on the transport properties

executed solely inside the GPU in parallel, and no data transfer between the

during turbulent multi-island magnetic reconnection. The particle acceleration
model is constructed for an ensemble of islands which produce adiabatic
compression of the particles. The model takes into account the statistical
fluctuations in the compression rate experienced by the particles during their
transport in the acceleration region. The evolution of the particle
distribution function is described as a simultaneous first and second-order
Fermi acceleration process. While the efficiency of the first-order process is
controlled by the average rate of compression, the second order process
involves the variance in the compression rate. Moreover, the acceleration
efficiency associated with the second-order process involves both the Eulerian
properties of the compression field and the Lagrangian properties of the
particles. The stochastic contribution to the acceleration is non-resonant and
can dominate the systematic part in the case of a large variance in the

the latter can be related to the large-scale turbulent transport of particles

Energy Loss of High-Energy Particles in Particle-in-Cell Simulation,http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5507v1,['Tsunehiko N. Kato'],"  When a charged particle moves through a plasma at a speed much higher than
the thermal velocity of the plasma, it is subjected to the force of the
electrostatic field induced in the plasma by itself and loses its energy. This
process is well-known as the stopping power of a plasma. In this paper we show
that the same process works in particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations as well and
the energy loss rate of fast particles due to this process is mainly determined
by the number of plasma electrons contained in the electron skin depth volume.
However, since there are generally very few particles in that volume in PIC
simulations compared with real plasmas, the energy loss effect can be
exaggerated significantly and can affect the results. Therefore, especially for
the simulations that investigate the particle acceleration processes, the
number of particles used in the simulations should be chosen large enough to
avoid this artificial energy loss.

which determines the motion of a particle with no external force, and an
external force vector. The position (state variable) of a particle at a given

the particle. The same projection transformation gives the position of the
particles with the same natural-frequency matrix. I show that the motion of the

distribution is given by an M-dimensional ordinary differential equation in
closed form. This result is an extension of the Ott-Antonsen theory.

Shear Jamming in Granular Experiments without Basal Friction,http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7355v2,"['Hu Zheng', 'Joshua A. Dijksman', 'Robert P. Behringer']","  Jammed states of frictional granular systems can be induced by shear strain

unclear, however, how much friction affects this so-called shear-jamming.
Friction appears in two ways in this type of experiment: friction between
particles, and friction between particles and the base on which they rest.
Here, we study how particle-bottom friction, or basal friction, affects shear
jamming in quasi-two dimensional experiments. In order to study this issue
experimentally, we apply simple shear to a disordered packing of photoelastic
disks. We can tune the basal friction of the particles by immersing the
particles in a density matched liquid, thus removing the normal force, hence
the friction, between the particles and base. We record the overall shear
stress, and particle motion, and the photoelastic response of the particles. We
compare the shear response of dry and immersed samples, which enables us to
determine how basal friction affects shear jamming. Our findings indicate that
changing the basal friction shifts the point of shear jamming, but it does not
change the basic phenomenon of shear jamming.

Faraday induction are calculated explicitly from the point-charge fields
derived from the Darwin Lagrangian for particles confined to move in a circular
orbit. For a one-particle circuit (or for N non-interacting particles), the
induced electromagnetic fields depend upon the mass and charge of the current
carriers while energy is transferred to the kinetic energy of the particle (or
particles). However, for an interacting multiparticle circuit, the mutual
electromagnetic interactions between particles can dominate the behavior so
that the mass and charge of the individual particles becomes irrelevant; the
induced fields are then comparable to the inducing fields and energy goes into
magnetic energy. In addition to providing a deeper understanding of
self-inductance, the example suggests that the claims involving hidden
mechanical momentum in connection with momentum balance for interacting
multiparticle systems are unlikely to be accurate.

the preferential concentration of larger-Stokes-number particles in low-speed

"Lagrangian Description for Particle Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics
  -- Entangled Many-Particle Case",http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02442v3,['Roderick Sutherland'],"  A Lagrangian formulation is constructed for particle interpretations of
quantum mechanics, a well-known example of such an interpretation being the
Bohm model. The advantages of such a description are that the equations for
particle motion, field evolution and conservation laws can all be deduced from
a single Lagrangian density expression. The formalism presented is Lorentz
invariant. This paper follows on from a previous one which was limited to the
single-particle case. The present paper treats the more general case of many
particles in an entangled state. It is found that describing more than one
particle while maintaining a relativistic description requires the
specification of final boundary conditions as well as the usual initial ones,
with the experimenter's controllable choice of the final conditions thereby
exerting a backwards-in-time influence. This retrocausality then allows an
important theoretical step forward to be made, namely that it becomes possible
to dispense with the usual, many-dimensional description in configuration space
and instead revert to a description in spacetime using separate,
single-particle wavefunctions.

  Near-Critical Binary Fluid Mixture within the Regime of the Gaussian Model",http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03512v2,['Youhei Fujitani'],"  The position of a colloidal particle trapped in an external field thermally
fluctuates at equilibrium. As is well known, the ambient fluid is not a simple
heat bath and the particle mass appears to increase, which influences the mean
square velocity of the particle. In this study, we suppose that the particle is
surrounded by a binary fluid mixture in the homogeneous phase near, but not too
close to, the critical point. Usually, one component is preferably attracted by
the particle surface, and the resultant adsorption layer becomes significant
because of the near-criticality. When the particle fluctuates in this
situation, its mean square displacement should also be influenced by the
ambient fluid because the adsorption layer does not follow the particle motion
totally. We calculate the influence in a simple case, where a rigid spherical
particle fluctuates with a small amplitude and its surface attracts one
component weakly. We utilize the hydrodynamics in the limit of no dissipation
to examine the contribution from the ambient mixture to the equal-time
correlation, which is shown to be reduced by an additional stress, including
osmotic pressure.

"Particle growth in turbulent flow under dynamically critical Stokes
  conditions",http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.04510v1,"['Michele Guala', 'Jiarong Hong']","  A simple theory, based on observations of snowflake distribution in a
turbulent flow, is proposed to model the growth of inertial particles as a
result of dynamic clustering at scales larger than the Kolmogorov length scale.
Particles able to stick or coalesce are expected to grow in size in flow
regions where preferential concentration is predicted by a critical Stokes
number $St=\tau_p/\tau_f \simeq 1 $. We postulate that, during growth, $St$
remains critical, with the particle response time $\tau_p$ evolving according
to the specific flow time scale $\tau_f$ defined by the vortices around which
progressively larger particles end up orbiting. This mechanism leads to the
prediction of the limiting size of aggregating particles in a turbulent flow.
Such limit is determined by the extent of the turbulent inertial range, which
can be formulated as a function of accessible integral-scale quantities. The
proposed dynamically critical Stokes growth provides a framework to interpret
particle aggregation, size growth and particle cluster growth in various
geophysical multi-phase flows.

unaffected by the introduction of Brownian motion effects in the simulations,

  mass terms",http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7442v3,"['Seishi Enomoto', 'Olga Fuksińska', 'Zygmunt Lalak']","  We have investigated effects of interaction terms on non-perturbative
particle production. It is well known that time-varying masses induce abundant
particle production. In this paper we have shown that it is possible to induce
particle production even if the mass term of a particle species is not varying
in time. Such particles are produced through the interactions with other
fields, whose mass terms are varying due to a time-dependent background. The
necessary formalism has been introduced and analytic and numerical calculations
have been performed in a simple but illustrative model. The rather general
result is that the amount of produced particles without time-dependent masses
can be comparable with the particle density produced directly by the varying
background if the strength of interaction terms is reasonably large.

when one kind of particles is driven against the other. According to
experimental observation, lane formation in binary complex plasmas occurs when
the smaller particles are driven through the stationary dust cloud of the
larger particles. We calculate the driving force acting on a probe particle
that finds itself in a quiescent cloud of particles in complex plasma of the
low-pressure radio frequency discharge under microgravity conditions. It is
shown that the nonzero driving force is a result of the dependence of the ion
mean free path on the particle number density. If this effect is properly
included in the model of similar complex plasmas then one arrives at the
driving force that changes its sign at the point where the probe and the dust
particles have equal radii. If the probe is smaller than the dust particle then
the driving force is directed toward the discharge center and vice versa, in

"A unified hyperbolic formulation for viscous fluids and elastoplastic
  solids",http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02151v1,"['Ilya Peshkov', 'Evgeniy Romenski', 'Michael Dumbser']","  We discuss a unified flow theory which in a single system of hyperbolic
partial differential equations (PDEs) can describe the two main branches of
continuum mechanics, fluid dynamics, and solid dynamics. The fundamental
difference from the classical continuum models, such as the Navier-Stokes for
example, is that the finite length scale of the continuum particles is not
ignored but kept in the model in order to semi-explicitly describe the essence
of any flows, that is the process of continuum particles rearrangements. To
allow the continuum particle rearrangements, we admit the deformability of
particle which is described by the distortion field. The ability of media to
flow is characterized by the strain dissipation time which is a characteristic
time necessary for a continuum particle to rearrange with one of its
neighboring particles. It is shown that the continuum particle length scale is
intimately connected with the dissipation time. The governing equations are
represented by a system of first order hyperbolic PDEs with source terms
modeling the dissipation due to particle rearrangements. Numerical examples
justifying the reliability of the proposed approach are demonstrated.

Segregation of charged particles in shear induced diffusion,http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04113v1,"['R. Yoshimatsu', 'N. A. M. Araújo', 'T. Shinbrot', 'H. J. Herrmann']","  We study segregation of a binary mixture of similarly charged particles under
shear using particle-based simulations. We simulate particle dynamics using a
discrete-element model including electrostatic interactions and find that
particles segregate according to their net charge. Particles that are charged
twice as strong as other particles of the same electrical sign are seen more at
insulating boundaries with which we shear the system. Weakly charged particles,
on the other hand, stay more in the center of the sheared bed. We propose a
simple model based on electrostatic potential energy to understand this
segregation. The model shows that the segregated system we observe in our
simulations is indeed the most favorable configuration in terms of
electrostatic potential energy. Our simulations further show that for a given
packing fraction there is an optimal shear velocity where the segregation
maximally intensifies. We show that this maximum results from a competition
between diffusional and Coulomb fluxes. For a larger shear velocity, diffusion
suppresses segregation.

transformations. The previous geodesic derivation existed some shortcomings.
Not only did geodesics of massive and massless particles are derived by using
quite different approaches, but also the treatment for massive case was
inconsistent with the variation principle of action. Recently, Wu et al have
remedied the shortcomings. In this paper, we introduce the improved treatment
in conformal gravity and derive geodesic equations of massive and massless
particles in a unified and self-consistent way. Although the result that the
black holes' entropy is not one-quarter of horizon area differs from that in
Einstein gravity, the tunneling probability of charged massive particles in
conformal gravity is still related to the change of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.

$N-1$ second class particles, and we assume that the first class particle is
initially at the leftmost position. In this case, we find the probability that
the first class particle is at $x$ and it is still the leftmost particle at

determinant of an $N\times N$ matrix of contour integrals if the initial
positions of particles satisfy the step initial condition. The resulting
formula is very similar to a known formula in the (usual) TASEP with the step
initial condition which was used for asymptotics by Nagao and Sasamoto [Nuclear

in suspension flow dynamics. The contact mechanics between particulate matter
in dispersions should depend sensitively on the composition of the dispersed
phase: evidently emulsion droplets interact differently with each other than
angular sand particles. We therefore ask: what is the role of contact mechanics
in dispersed media flow? We focus on slow flows, where contacts are
long-lasting and hence contact mechanics effects should be most visible. To
answer our question, we synthesize soft hydrogel particles with different
friction coefficients. By making the particles soft, we can drive them at
finite confining pressure at all driving rates. For particles with a low
friction coefficient, we obtain a rheology similar to that of an emulsion, yet
with an effective friction much larger than expected from their microscopic
contact mechanics. Increasing the friction coefficient of the particles, we
find a flow instability in the suspension. Particle level flow and fluctuations
are also greatly affected by the microscopic friction coefficient of the
suspended particles. The specific rheology of our ""granular emulsions"" provides
further evidence that a better understanding of microscopic particle
interactions is of broad relevance for dispersed media flows.

quantum mechanics. Many delayed-choice experiments have been performed to
further understand the wave-particle duality. Here, we reveal some flaws in the
known interference theories by comparing the theoretical predictions with the
experimental facts and show that the presence of media is a necessary condition
for interference of single photons, a photon interferes with other photon via
microscopic particles in the interface of media, and the wave-like property of
a photon originates from interaction between the photon and media; the particle
property is the inherent characteristic of a photon, and the wave-like behavior
of a photon always accompanies the particle behavior; the coherent time of
single photons cannot be longer than the lifetime of the polarized states of
the microscopic particles. Interference of single photons is interpreted
properly, and the conundrum of the wave-particle duality is well solved.

to gradients in the concentration of the small particles. The model predicts
that stratification only occurs over a range of initial concentrations of the
smaller colloidal species. At concentrations that are either too low or too

showing that it is possible, in principle, to find specific conditions for

distribution of the prices of a stock market blue chip is calculated as the
wave function of a quantum particle confined in a potential well. This model
may naturally explain the operation of several empirical rules used by
technical analysts. Models based on the movement of a Brownian particle do not
account for fundamental aspects of financial markets. This is due to the fact
that the Brownian particle is a classical particle, while stock market prices
behave more like quantum particles. When a classical particle meets an obstacle
or a potential barrier, it may either bounce or overcome the obstacle, yet not
both at a time. Only a quantum particle can simultaneously reflect and transmit
itself on a potential barrier. This is precisely what prices in a stock market
imitate when they find a resistance level: they partially bounce against and
partially overcome it. This can only be explained by admitting that prices
behave as quantum rather than as classic particles. The proposed quantum model
finds natural justification not only for the aforementioned facts but also for
other empirically well-known facts such as sudden changes in volatility,
non-Gaussian distribution in prices, among others.

macro-scopic behavior of granular systems. This paper presents a combined 3D
thinning and greedy set-covering algorithm to approximate realistic particles
with a clump of overlapping spheres for discrete element method (DEM)
simulations. First, the particle medial surface (or surface skeleton), from
which all candidate (maximal inscribed) spheres can be generated, is computed
by the topological 3D thinning. Then, the clump generation procedure is
converted into a greedy set-covering (SCP) problem.
  To correct the mass distribution due to highly overlapped spheres inside the
clump, linear programming (LP) is used to adjust the density of each component
sphere, such that the aggregate properties mass, center of mass and inertia
tensor are identical or close enough to the prototypical particle. In order to
find the optimal approximation accuracy (volume coverage: ratio of clump's
volume to the original particle's volume), particle flow of 3 different shapes

repose starts to converge for all particle shapes at 85% volume coverage

resampling with an optimal-transport map and can be localised by computing maps

Periodic particle arrangements using standing acoustic waves,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08664v1,"['Fernando Guevara Vasquez', 'China Mauck']","  We determine crystal-like materials that can be fabricated by using a
standing acoustic wave to arrange small particles in a non-viscous liquid
resin, which is cured afterwards to keep the particles in the desired
locations. For identical spherical particles with the same physical properties
and small compared to the wavelength, the locations where the particles are
trapped correspond to the minima of an acoustic radiation potential which
describes the net forces that a particle is subject to. We show that the global
minima of spatially periodic acoustic radiation potentials can be predicted by
the eigenspace of a small real symmetric matrix corresponding to its smallest
eigenvalue. We relate symmetries of this eigenspace to particle arrangements
composed of points, lines or planes. Since waves are used to generate the
particle arrangements, the arrangement's periodicity is limited to certain
Bravais lattice classes that we enumerate in two and three dimensions.

property-enhancing particles in the nanometer-size range and below, and plays a
prominent role in the analysis of solute clusters. However, the question of how
well these small particles are measured has never been addressed because of a
lack of a reliable benchmark. Here, to address this critical gap, we use an
approach that allows direct comparison of APT and small-angle (X-Ray)
scattering (SA(X)S) performed on the same material. Our results demonstrate
that the size and composition of particles with a radius below
\SI{1}{\nano\meter} (\textapprox\num{250} atoms) cannot be accurately measured,
even though the particles are detected. We introduce the notion of an effective
spatial resolution for the analysis of particles, which, importantly in this
context, is very different than the technique's inherent spatial resolution.
This thorough metrological assessment of APT in the analysis of particles
allows us to discuss the pulse spread function of the technique and the reasons
underpinning its limits. We conclude that great care should be taken when
analysing solute clusters by APT, in particular when reporting particle size

Timelike Geodesic Motion in Horava-Lifshitz Spacetime,http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.2786v3,"['Juhua Chen', 'Yongjiu Wang']","  Recently Ho$\breve{r}$ava proposed a non-relativistic renormalisable theory
of gravitation. When restricted to satisfy the condition of detailed balance,
this theory is intimately related to topologically massive gravity in three
dimensions, and the geometry of the Cotton tensor. At long distances, this
theory is expected to flow to the relativistic value $\lambda = 1$, and could
therefore serve as a possible candidate for a UV completion of Einstein general
relativity or an infrared modification thereof. In this paper under allowing
the lapse function to depend on the spatial coordinates $x^i$ as well as $t$,
we obtain the spherically symmetric solutions. And then by analyzing the
behavior of the effective potential for the particle, we investigate the
timelike geodesic motion of particle in the Ho$\breve{r}$ava-Lifshitz

the center along the timelike geodesics when its energy is in an appropriate
range. However, we find that it is complexity for radial particle along the
timelike geodesics. There are follow different cases due to the energy of
radial particle: 1) When the energy of radial particle is higher than a
critical value $E_{C}$, the particle will fall from infinity to the singularity
directly; 2) When the energy of radial particle equals to the critical value
$E_{C}$, the particle orbit is unstable at $r=r_{C}$, i.e. the particle will
escape from $r=r_{C}$ to the infinity or to the singularity, which is
determined by the initial conditions of the particle; 3) When the energy of
radial particle is in a proper range, the particle will rebound to the infinity

  Formation",http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0109v2,"['Hanno Rein', 'Geoffroy Lesur', 'Zoe M. Leinhardt']","  The formation mechanism of planetesimals in protoplanetary discs is hotly
debated. Currently, the favoured model involves the accumulation of meter-sized
objects within a turbulent disc, followed by a phase of gravitational
instability. At best one can simulate a few million particles numerically as
opposed to the several trillion meter-sized particles expected in a real
protoplanetary disc. Therefore, single particles are often used as
super-particles to represent a distribution of many smaller particles. It is
assumed that small scale phenomena do not play a role and particle collisions
are not modeled. The super-particle approximation can only be valid in a
collisionless or strongly collisional system, however, in many recent numerical
simulations this is not the case.
  In this work we present new results from numerical simulations of
planetesimal formation via gravitational instability. A scaled system is
studied that does not require the use of super-particles. We find that the
scaled particles can be used to model the initial phases of clumping if the
properties of the scaled particles are chosen such that all important
timescales in the system are equivalent to what is expected in a real
protoplanetary disc. Constraints are given for the number of particles needed
in order to achieve numerical convergence.
  We compare this new method to the standard super-particle approach. We find
that the super-particle approach produces unreliable results that depend on
artifacts such as the gravitational softening in both the requirement for
gravitational collapse and the resulting clump statistics. Our results show
that short range interactions (collisions) have to be modelled properly.

The Smallest Particles in Saturn's A and C Rings,http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.2927v1,"['Rebecca A. Harbison', 'Philip D. Nicholson', 'Matthew M. Hedman']","  Radio occultations of Saturn's main rings by spacecraft suggest a power law
particle size-distribution down to sizes of the order of 1 cm (Marouf et al.,
1983), (Zebker et al., 1985). The lack of optical depth variations between
ultraviolet and near-IR wavelengths indicate a lack of micron-sized particles.
Between these two regimes, the particle-size distribution is largely unknown. A
cutoff where the particle-size distribution turns over must exist, but the
position and shape of it is not clear from existing studies.
  Using a series of solar occultations performed by the VIMS instrument
on-board Cassini in the near-infrared, we are able to measure light forward
scattered by particles in the A and C rings. With a model of diffraction by
ring particles, and the previous radio work as a constraint on the slope of the
particle size distribution, we estimate the minimum particle size using a
truncated power-law size distribution. The C Ring shows a minimum particle size
of $4.1^{+3.8}_{-1.3}$ mm, with an assumed power law index of q=3.1 and a
maximum particle size of 10 m.
  The A Ring signal shows a similar level of scattered flux, but modeling is
complicated by the presence of self-gravity wakes and higher optical depths. If
q<3, our A Ring model requires a minimum particle size below one millimeter (<
0.34 mm for an assumed q=2.75, or $0.56^{+0.35}_{-0.16}$ mm for a steeper
q=2.9) to be consistent with VIMS observations. These results might seem to
contradict previous optical(Dones et al., 1993) and infrared (French and
Nicholson, 2000) work, which implied that there were few particles in the A
Ring smaller than 1 cm. But, because of the shallow power law, relatively
little optical depth (between 0.03 and 0.16 in extinction, or 0.015 - 0.08 in
absorption) is provided by these particles.

size-based particle separation in microfluidic pinched flow fractionation. We
study the behavior of particles moving through a pinching gap (i.e., a
constriction in the aperture of a channel) in the Stokes regime as a function
of particle size. The constriction aperture is created by a plane wall and
spherical obstacle, and emulates the pinching segment in pinched flow
fractionation devices. The simulation results show that the distance of closest
approach between the particle and obstacle surfaces (along a trajectory)
decreases with increasing particle size. We then use the distance of closest
approach to investigate the effect of short-range repulsive non-hydrodynamic
interactions (e.g., solid-solid contact). We define a critical trajectory as
the one in which the minimum particle-obstacle separation is equal to the range
of the non-hydrodynamic interactions. The results further show that the initial
offset of the critical trajectory (defined as the critical offset) increases
with particle size. We interpret the variation of the critical offset with
particle size as the basis for size-based microfluidic separation in pinched
flow fractionation. We also compare the effect of different driving fields on
the particle trajectories; we simulate a constant force driving the particles
in a quiescent fluid as well as a freely suspended particles in a
pressure-driven flow. We observe that the particles driven by a constant force
approach closer to the obstacle than those suspended in a flow (for the same
initial offset). On the other hand, the increment in the critical offset (as a
function of particle size) is larger in the pressure-driven case than in the
force-driven case. Thus, pressure-driven particle separation using pinched flow
fractionation would prove more effective than its force-driven counterpart.

manufacturing processes is very important for process and product development
because design of downstream processes as well as final product properties

particle size and shape information in situ during crystallisation processes
has been a major challenge. The focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM)
provides the chord length distribution (CLD) of a population of particles in a

information from the CLD requires a model relating particle size and shape to
its CLD as well as solving the corresponding inverse problem.

While the algorithm searches for a global best solution to the inverse problem

techniques based on relevant additional information can be implemented as
required to obtain physically reasonable size distributions. We used the

for thin cylinders to estimate particle size distribution and shape. We found
that the thin cylinder model yielded significantly better agreement with

of the curvature on micro-particle transport and accumulation. It is shown that
even a slight non-zero curvature in the flow configuration strongly impact the
particle concentration map such that the concentration of inertial particles
with bulk Stokes number 0.45 (based on bulk velocity and pipe radius) at the
inner-bend wall of mildly curved pipe becomes 12.8 times larger than that in
the viscous sublayer of the straight pipe. Near-wall helicoidal particle
streaks are observed in the curved configurations with their inclination
varying with the strength of the secondary motion of the carrier phase. A
reflection layer, as previously observed in particle laden turbulent S-shaped
channels, is also apparent in the strongly curved pipe with heavy particles. In
addition, depending on the curvature, the central regions of the mean Dean
vortices appear to be completely depleted of particles, as observed also in the
partially re-laminarised region at the inner bend. The turbophoretic drift of
the particles is shown to be affected by weak and strong secondary motions of

second-order moments of the velocity and acceleration of the particulate phase

spacetime transcending the Kerr bound only by an infinitesimal amount, i.e.,
with the Kerr parameter $a=M(1+\epsilon)$, where we take the limit $\epsilon

use the laws of relativistic kinematics. It is sufficient to account for the
relativistic dependence of particles momenta on the velocity in the second
Newton's law. Then, the coupling of fields and particles is based on the use of
result from particle dynamics treated according to Newton's laws in terms of

interactions are incorporated through an efficient and second-order accurate
immersed boundary method (IBM). Short-range interactions are also partly
reproduced by the IBM. However, since the IBM uses a fixed-grid, a lubrication
model is needed for an inter-particle gap width smaller than the grid spacing.
The lubrication model is based on asymptotic expansions of analytical solutions

Roughness effects are incorporated by making the lubrication correction
independent of the gap width for gap widths smaller than $\sim 1\%$ of the

single-phase flows: the unladen case, and the flow of a Newtonian fluid with
the effective suspension viscosity of the same mixture in the laminar regime.
As recently highlighted in Costa et al. (PRL 117, 134501), a particle-wall
layer is responsible for deviations of the statistics from what is observed in
the continuum limit where the suspension is modeled as a Newtonian fluid with
an effective viscosity. Here we investigate the fluid and particle dynamics in
this layer and in the bulk. In the particle-wall layer, the near wall
inhomogeneity has an influence on the suspension micro-structure over a
distance proportional to the particle size. In this layer, particles have a
significant (apparent) slip velocity that is reflected in the distribution of
wall shear stresses. This is characterized by extreme events (both much higher
and much lower than the mean). Based on these observations we provide a scaling
for the particle-to-fluid apparent slip velocity as a function of the flow
parameters. We also extend the flow scaling laws in to second-order Eulerian
statistics in the homogeneous suspension region away from the wall. Finite-size
effects in the bulk of the channel become important for larger particles, while
negligible for lower-order statistics and smaller particles. Finally, we study
the particle dynamics along the wall-normal direction. Our results suggest that

"A unified analysis of nano-to-microscale particle dispersion in tubular
  blood flow",http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11202v4,"['Zixiang Liu', 'Jonathan R. Clausen', 'Rekha R. Rao', 'Cyrus K. Aidun']","  Transport of solid particles in blood flow exhibits qualitative differences
in the transport mechanism when the particle varies from nanoscale to
microscale size comparable to the red blood cell (RBC). The effect of
microscale particle margination has been investigated by several groups. Also,
the transport of nanoscale particles (NPs) in blood has received considerable
attention in the past. This study attempts to bridge the gap by quantitatively
showing how the transport mechanism varies with particle size from nano- to
microscale. Using a three-dimensional (3D) multiscale method, the dispersion of
particles in microscale tubular flows is investigated for various hematocrits,
vessel diameters and particle sizes. NPs exhibit a nonuniform,
smoothly-dispersed distribution across the tube radius due to severe Brownian
motion. The near-wall concentration of NPs can be moderately enhanced by
increasing hematocrit and confinement. Moreover, there exists a critical
particle size ($\sim$1 $\mu$m) that leads to excessive retention of particles
in the cell-free region near the wall, i.e., margination. Above this threshold,
the margination propensity increases with the particle size. The dominance of
RBC-enhanced shear-induced diffusivity (RESID) over Brownian diffusivity (BD)
results in 10 times higher radial diffusion rates in the RBC-laden region
compared to that in the cell-free layer, correlated with the high margination
propensity of microscale particles. This work captures the particle
size-dependent transition from Brownian-motion dominant dispersion to
margination using a unified 3D multiscale computational approach, and
highlights the linkage between the radial distribution of RESID and the
margination of particles in confined blood flows.

"Interface-resolved simulations of small inertial particles in turbulent
  channel flow",http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01249v5,"['Pedro Costa', 'Luca Brandt', 'Francesco Picano']","  We present a direct comparison between interface-resolved and one-way-coupled
point-particle direct numerical simulations (DNS) of gravity-free turbulent
channel flow laden with small inertial particles, with high particle-to-fluid
density ratio and diameter of about $3$ viscous units. The most dilute flow
considered, solid volume fraction $O(10^{-5})$, shows the particle feedback on
the flow to be negligible, whereas differences with respect to the unladen
case, noteworthy a drag increase of about $10\%$, are found for a volume
fraction $O(10^{-4})$. This is attributed to a dense layer of particles at the
wall, caused by turbophoresis, flowing with large particle-to-fluid apparent
slip velocity. The most dilute case is therefore taken as the benchmark for
assessing the validity of a widely used point-particle model, where the
particle dynamics results only from inertial and nonlinear drag forces. In the
bulk of the channel, the first- and second-order moments of the particle
velocity from the point-particle DNS agree well with those from the
interface-resolved DNS. Close to the wall, however, most of the statistics show
major qualitative differences. We show that this difference originates from the
strong shear-induced lift force acting on the particles in the near-wall
region. This mechanism is well captured by the lift force model due to Saffman
(J. Fluid Mech., vol. 22 (2), 1965, pp. 385--400), while other widely used,
more elaborate, approaches aiming at extending the lift model for a wider range
of particle Reynolds numbers can actually underpredict the magnitude of the
near-wall particle velocity fluctuations for the cases analysed here.

Ref. [1], to numerically explore the finite-volume spectrum of three
relativistic particles, in the case that two-particle subsets are either

quantization condition was derived under a technical assumption on the
two-particle K matrix that required the absence of two-particle bound states or
narrow two-particle resonances. Here we describe how this restriction can be
lifted in a simple way using the freedom in the definition of the K-matrix-like
quantity that enters the quantization condition. With this in hand, we extend
previous numerical studies of the quantization condition to explore the
finite-volume signature for a variety of two- and three-particle interactions.
We determine the spectrum for parameters such that the system contains both
dimers (two-particle bound states) and one or more trimers (in which all three
particles are bound), and also for cases where the two-particle subchannel is
resonant. We also show how the quantization condition provides a tool for
determining infinite-volume dimer-particle scattering amplitudes for energies
below the dimer breakup. We illustrate this for a series of examples, including
one that parallels physical deuteron-nucleon scattering. All calculations

Solid quantization for non-point particles,http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.0842v3,['P. Wang'],"  In quantum field theory, elemental particles are assumed to be point
particles. As a result, the loop integrals are divergent in many cases.
Regularization and renormalization are necessary in order to get the physical
finite results from the infinite, divergent loop integrations. We propose new
quantization conditions for non-point particles. With this solid quantization,
divergence could be treated systematically. This method is useful for effective
field theory which is on hadron degrees of freedom. The elemental particles
could also be non-point ones. They can be studied in this approach as well.

Attractive n-type contact processes,http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.5723v2,['Joseph Stover'],"  Interacting particle systems are continuous time Markov processes which are
used to construct models in many disciplines. Monotonicity is a property that
some interacting particle systems possess. A monotone interacting particle
system is called attractive. A benefit of attractiveness is that it simplifies
certain calculations, one of which is the ability to use some computational
algorithms to sample exactly from the stationary distribution of an ergodic
process. Monotonicity is well understood for spin systems such as the contact
process. Spin systems only include two particle types however, while in many
applied models, it is desirable to include more species of particles. In this
paper a general framework of monotonicity will be outlined for a certain class
of multitype contact processes.

processes of strongly coupled dusty plasma that reflect the nature of inter
particle interaction and characterize thermodynamics of the system. In this
paper the effect of magnetic field on diffusion of dust particles in strongly
coupled dusty plasma is investigated by using molecular dynamics simulations.
Self- diffusion coefficients of Yukawa systems are obtained for a wide range of
plasma parameters and magnetic field strength using Green- Kubo expression
which is based on integrated velocity autocorrelation function (VACF). It is
assumed that dust particles interact with each other by modified Yukawa (i.e.
screened Coulomb) potential. The study gives interesting results of dust
particle diffusion in magnetized plasma.

"A Local and Discrete Model Simulating Nonrelativistic Quantum Mechanical
  Systems",http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08232v1,['Antonio Sciarretta'],"  This paper presents a simple model that mimics quantum mechanics (QM) results
without using complex wavefunctions or non-localities. The proposed model only
uses integer-valued quantities and arithmetic operations, in particular
assuming a discrete spacetime under the form of a Euclidean lattice. The
proposed approach describes individual particle trajectories as random walks.
Transition probabilities are simple functions of a few quantities that are
either randomly associated to the particles during their preparation, or stored
in the lattice nodes they visit during the walk. Non-relativistic QM
predictions are retrieved as probability distributions of similarly-prepared
ensembles of particles. The scenarios considered to assess the model comprise
of free particle, constant external force, harmonic oscillator, particle in a
box, and the Delta potential.

Gauge Freedom within the Class of Linear Feedback Particle Filters,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06689v2,"['Ehsan Abedi', 'Simone Carlo Surace']","  Feedback particle filters (FPFs) are Monte-Carlo approximations of the
solution of the filtering problem in continuous time. The samples or particles
evolve according to a feedback control law in order to track the posterior
distribution. However, it is known that by itself, the requirement to track the
posterior does not lead to a unique algorithm. Given a particle filter, another
one can be constructed by applying a time-dependent transformation of the
particles that keeps the posterior distribution invariant. Here, we
characterize this gauge freedom within the class of FPFs for the
linear-Gaussian filtering problem, and thereby extend previously known
parametrized families of linear FPFs.

studying the time evolution of systems of particles interacting via gravity and

public-domain serial Adaptive P3M code of Couchman et al. The algorithm
resolves gravitational forces into a long-range component computed by
discretizing the mass distribution and solving Poisson's equation on a grid
using an FFT convolution method, and a short-range component computed by direct
force summation for sufficiently close particle pairs. The code consists
primarily of a particle-particle computation parallelized by domain
decomposition over blocks of neighbour-cells, a more regular mesh calculation
distributed in planes along one dimension, and several transformations between
the two distributions. The load balancing of the P3M code is static, since this
greatly aids the ongoing implementation of parallel adaptive refinements of the

Particle Pile-ups and Planetesimal Formation,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0309247v2,"['Andrew N. Youdin', 'Eugene I. Chiang']","  Solid particles in protoplanetary disks that are sufficiently super-solar in
metallicity overcome turbulence generated by vertical shear to gravitationally
condense into planetesimals. Super-solar metallicities result if solid
particles pile up as they migrate starward as a result of aerodynamic drag.
Previous analyses of aerodynamic drift rates that account for mean flow
differences between gas and particles yield particle pile-ups. We improve on
these studies not only by accounting for the collective inertia of solids
relative to that of gas, but also by including the transport of angular
momentum by turbulent stresses within the particle layer. These turbulent
stresses are derived in a physically self-consistent manner from the structure
of marginally Kelvin-Helmholtz turbulent flows. They are not calculated using
the usual plate drag formulae, whose use we explain is inappropriate.
Accounting for the relative inertia of solids to gas retards, but does not
prevent, particle pile-ups, and generates more spatially extended regions of
metal enrichment. Turbulent transport hastens pile-ups. We conclude that
particle pile-up is a robust outcome in sufficiently passive protoplanetary
disks. Connections to observations of circumstellar disks, including the Kuiper

describe light scattering by such composite particles. Both a model of layered
particles and discrete dipole calculations for particles with Rayleigh and

a key parameter for determining light scattering. We find that the optical
properties of the layered particles depend on the number and position of layers
if the number of layers is small ($\la 15$). For a larger number of layers the
scattering characteristics become independent of the layer sequence. The
optical properties of particles with inclusions depend on the size of
inclusions provided the porosity is large. The scattering characteristics of
very porous particles with inclusions of different sizes are found to be close
to those of multi-layered spheres. We compare the results of these calculations
with the predictions of the effective medium theories (EMT) which are often
used in astronomy as a tool to calculate the optical properties of composite

typically predicted for cosmic dust, we show that the spectral signature

molecular dynamics simulations. To investigate the dynamics we focus on events
(""jumps"") where a particle escapes the cage formed by its neighbors. Using
single particle trajectories we define a jump by comparing for each particle
its fluctuations with its changes in average position. We find two kinds of
jumps: ""reversible jumps,"" where a particle jumps back and forth between two or
more average positions, and ""irreversible jumps,"" where a particle does not
return to any of its former average positions. For all investigated
temperatures both kinds of particles jump and both irreversible and reversible
jumps occur. With increasing temperature relaxation is enhanced by an
increasing number of jumps, and growing jump lengths in position and potential
energy. However, the waiting time between two successive jumps is independent
of temperature. This temperature independence might be due to aging, which is
present in our system. The ratio of irreversible to reversible jumps is also
increasing with increasing temperature, which we interpret as a consequence of
the increased likelihood of changes in the cages, i.e. a blocking of the
""entrance"" back into the previous cage. A comparison of the fluctuations of
jumping particles and non-jumping particles indicates that jumping particles
are more mobile even when not jumping. The jumps in energy normalized by their
fluctuations are decreasing with increasing temperature, which is consistent
with relaxation being increasingly driven by thermal fluctuations. In
accordance with subdiffusive behavior are the distributions of waiting times

a TiC particle will be formed in the cell. Accordingly, the molecular dynamic

also shown that the cumulative effect of the far-field flow substantially
influences the force distribution in arrays of immobile spheres. Therefore, the

evaluating many-particle hydrodynamic interactions in the parallel-wall

"About Possibility for Examination of Gravity Theories Using the Precise
  Measurement of Particle Lifetime",http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0308128v1,['Kh. M. Beshtoev'],"  An approach for examination of gravitational theories using precision
measurements of particle lifetime is proposed. The expressions describing
dependence of particle lifetime on gravitational potential in Einstein's and
Newton's gravity theories are obtained. In the case of Newton's gravity there
is a dependence of the particle velocity direction from the direction of matter
location, which creates the gravitational potential. If the external
gravitational field is spherical symmetric then there would be no possibility
to distinguish these types of gravity. It is found that the deposit of
gravitational potential of the Universe (in the case of uniformly distribution
of matter in the Universe) in particle lifetime is approximately one percent.
On the basis of the available experimental data it is found that deposit of
asymmetric gravitational field is $\frac{\phi}{c^2} \simeq 2 \cdot 10^{-4}$,
i.e., if the experimental precision of particle lifetime measurements will be
several units of $10^{-4}$, then we could see this effect.
  In reality, the lifetime of elementary particles can be defined by effective
masses of these particles in the external gravitational field. The expressions
for effective masses of particles in the external gravitational field for two
gravity type theories are obtained. These masses can be used at computation of
the decay probability (or lifetime) of particles by standard methods. It is
shown that in this case it is also possible to distinguish these two types of
gravity theories.

The kinetic limit of a system of coagulating Brownian particles,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0408395v3,"['Alan Hammond', 'Fraydoun Rezakhanlou']","  We consider a random model of diffusion and coagulation. A large number of
small particles are randomly scattered at an initial time. Each particle has
some integer mass and moves in a Brownian motion whose diffusion rate is
determined by that mass. When any two particles are close, they are liable to
combine into a single particle that bears the mass of each of them. Choosing
the initial density of particles so that, if their size is very small, a
typical one is liable to interact with a unit order of other particles in a
unit of time, we determine the macroscopic evolution of the system, in any
dimension d \geq 3. The density of particles evolves according to the
Smoluchowski system of PDEs, indexed by the mass parameter, in which the
interaction term is a sum of products of densities. Central to the proof is
establishing the so-called Stosszahlensatz, which asserts that, at any given
time, the presence of particles of two distinct masses at any given point in
macroscopic space is asymptotically independent, as the size of the particles
is taken towards zero.

"A Model for Predicting Magnetic Targeting of Multifunctional Particles
  in the Microvasculature",http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0612116v1,"['E. J. Furlani', 'E. P. Furlani']","  A mathematical model is presented for predicting magnetic targeting of
multifunctional carrier particles that are designed to deliver therapeutic
agents to malignant tissue in vivo. These particles consist of a nonmagnetic
core material that contains embedded magnetic nanoparticles and therapeutic
agents such as photodynamic sensitizers. For in vivo therapy, the particles are
injected into the vascular system upstream from malignant tissue, and captured
at the tumor using an applied magnetic field. The applied field couples to the
magnetic nanoparticles inside the carrier particle and produces a force that
attracts the particle to the tumor. In noninvasive therapy the applied field is
produced by a permanent magnet positioned outside the body. In this paper a
mathematical model is developed for predicting noninvasive magnetic targeting
of therapeutic carrier particles in the microvasculature. The model takes into
account the dominant magnetic and fluidic forces on the particles and leads to
an analytical expression for predicting their trajectory. An analytical
expression is also derived for predicting the volume fraction of embedded
magnetic nanoparticles required to ensure capture of the carrier particle at
the tumor. The model enables rapid parametric analysis of magnetic targeting as
a function of key variables including the size of the carrier particle, the
properties and volume fraction of the embedded magnetic nanoparticles, the
properties of the magnet, the microvessel, the hematocrit of the blood and its

"Discrete time quantum walk model for single and entangled particles to
  retain entanglement in coin space",http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0609113v4,['C. M. Chandrashekar'],"  In most widely discussed discrete time quantum walk model, after every
unitary shift operator, the particle evolves into the superposition of position
space and settles down in one of its basis states, loosing entanglement in the
coin space in the new position. The Hadamard operation is applied to let the
particle to evolve into the superposition in the coin space and the walk is
iterated. We present a model with a additional degree of freedom for the
unitary shift operator $U^{\prime}$. The unitary operator with additional
degree of freedom will evolve the quantum particle into superposition of
position space retaining the entanglement in coin space. This eliminates the
need for quantum coin toss (Hadamard operation) after every unitary
displacement operation as used in most widely studied version of the discrete
time quantum walk model. This construction is easily extended to a multiple
particle quantum walk and in this article we extend it for a pair of particles
in pure state entangled in coin degree of freedom by simultaneously subjecting
it to a pair of unitary displacement operators which were constructed for
single particle. We point out that unlike for single particle quantum walk,
upon measurement of its position after $N$ steps, the entangled particles are
found together with 1/2 probability and at different positions with 1/2
probability. This can act as an advantage in applications of the quantum walk.
A special case is also treated using a complex physical system such as, inter
species two-particle entangled Bose-Einstein condensate, as an example.

to circumvent at least two hurdles, namely the rapid loss of material due to
radial drift and particle fragmentation due to destructive collisions. In this
paper, we present the results of numerical simulations with more and more
realistic physics involved. Step by step, we include various effects, such as
particle growth, radial/vertical particle motion and dust particle
fragmentation in our simulations. We demonstrate that the initial dust-to-gas

this value is increased by a factor of 2 compared with the canonical value for
the interstellar medium, km-sized bodies can form in the inner disk <2 AU

through collisional fragmentation. Only with the unrealistically high-threshold
velocities needed for fragmentation to occur (>30 m/s), particles are able to
grow to larger sizes in low turbulent disks. We also find that less than 5% of
the small dust grains remain in the disk after 1 Myrs due to radial drift, no

Sources of zodiacal dust,http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.2624v1,['S. I. Ipatov'],"  Fractions of asteroidal particles, particles originating beyond Jupiter's
orbit (including trans-Neptunian particles), and cometary particles originating

with a possible deviation from 1/3 up to 0.1-0.2. These estimates were based on
the comparison of our models of the zodiacal cloud that use results of
numerical integration of the orbital evolution of dust particles produced by
asteroids, comets, and trans-Neptunian objects with different observations
(e.g., WHAM [Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper spectrometer] observations of spectra of
zodiacal light, the number density at different distances from the Sun). The

observations of dust inside Jupiter's orbit, they cannot be dominant in the

distance from the Sun shows that trans-Neptunian particles cannot be dominant
between orbits of Jupiter and Saturn. Mean eccentricities of zodiacal particles

reconnection in providing seed particles to the region of strong electric field

requires approximately double the time in fan reconnection. The steady-state
energy spectrum at intermediate energies (protons 1 keV to 0.1 MeV) is
comparable in the fan and spine regimes. While in spine reconnection particle
escape takes place in two symmetric jets along the spine, in fan reconnection
no jets are produced and particles escape in the fan plane, in a ribbon-like

"Particle and Wave: Developing the Quantum Wave Accompanying a Classical
  Particle",http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.1026v1,['C. L. Herzenberg'],"  The relationship between classical and quantum mechanics is explored in an
intuitive manner by the exercise of constructing a wave in association with a
classical particle. Using special relativity, the time coordinate in the frame
of reference of a moving particle is expressed in terms of the coordinates in
the laboratory frame of reference in order to provide an initial spatiotemporal
function to work from in initiating the development of a quantum wave. When
temporal periodicity is ascribed to the particle, a provisional spatiotemporal
function for a particle travelling at constant velocity manifests itself as an
running wave characterized by parameters associated with the moving particle. A
wave description for bidirectional motion is generated based on an average time
coordinate for a combination of oppositely directed elementary running waves,
and the resulting spatiotemporal function exhibits wave behavior characteristic
of a standing wave. Ascribing directional orientation to the intrinsic
periodicity of the particle introduces directional sub-states; variations in
the relative number of sub-states as a function of angle in combined states
lead to spatially varying magnitudes for the associated waves. Further analysis
leads to full mathematical expression for all waves representing free particle
motion. A generalization for particles subject to force fields enables us to
develop a governing differential equation identical in form to the Schroedinger
equation.

corresponding to ""subluminal"" shocks, where relativistic particles following
the magnetic field can escape ahead of the shock, lead to particle
acceleration. The downstream spectrum in such shocks consists of a relativistic
Maxwellian and a high-energy power-law tail with exponential cutoff. For
increasing magnetic inclination in the subluminal range, the high-energy tail
accounts for an increasing fraction of particles (from ~1% to ~2%) and energy
(from ~4% to ~12%). The spectral index of the power law increases with angle
from -2.8+-0.1 to -2.3+-0.1. Particle energization is driven by the Diffusive
Shock Acceleration process for nearly parallel shocks, and switches to
Shock-Drift Acceleration for larger subluminal inclinations. For ""superluminal""
shocks, the downstream particle spectrum does not show any significant
suprathermal tail. As seen from the upstream frame, efficient acceleration in
relativistic (Lorentz factor gamma0 > 5) magnetized (sigma > 0.03) flows exists

Anisotropic clustering of inertial particles in homogeneous shear flow,http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.0893v1,"['P. Gualtieri', 'F. Picano', 'C. M. Casciola']","  Recently, clustering of inertial particles in turbulence has been thoroughly
analyzed for statistically homogeneous isotropic flows. Phenomenologically,
spatial homogeneity of particles configurations is broken by the advection of a
range of eddies determined by the Stokes relaxation time of the particles which
results in a multi-scale distribution of local concentrations and voids. Much
less is known concerning anisotropic flows. Here, by addressing direct
numerical simulations (DNS) of a statistically steady particle-laden
homogeneous shear flow, we provide evidence that the mean shear preferentially
orients particle patterns. By imprinting anisotropy on large scales velocity
fluctuations, the shear indirectly affects the geometry of the clusters.
Quantitative evaluation is provided by a purposely designed tool, the angular
distribution function of particle pairs (ADF), which allows to address the
anisotropy content of particles aggregates on a scale by scale basis. The data
provide evidence that, depending on the Stokes relaxation time of the
particles, anisotropic clustering may occur even in the range of scales where
the carrier phase velocity field is already recovering isotropy. The strength
of the singularity in the anisotropic component of the ADF quantifies the level
of fine scale anisotropy, which may even reach values of more than 30%
direction-dependent variation in the probability to find two close-by particles
at viscous scale separation.

particles in an advection-dominated accretion disk is analyzed using a
transport formalism that includes first-order Fermi acceleration, advection,
spatial diffusion, and the escape of particles through the upper and lower
surfaces of the disk. When a centrifugally-supported shock is present in the
disk, the concentrated particle acceleration occurring in the vicinity of the
shock channels a significant fraction of the binding energy of the accreting
gas into a population of relativistic particles. These high-energy particles
diffuse vertically through the disk and escape, carrying away both energy and
entropy and allowing the remaining gas to accrete. The dynamical structure of
the disk/shock system is computed self-consistently using a model previously
developed by the authors that successfully accounts for the production of the
observed relativistic outflows (jets) in M87 and \SgrA. This ensures that the
rate at which energy is carried away from the disk by the escaping relativistic
particles is equal to the drop in the radial energy flux at the shock location,
as required for energy conservation. We investigate the influence of advection,
diffusion, and acceleration on the particle distribution by computing the
nonthermal Green's function, which displays a relatively flat power-law tail at
high energies. We also obtain the energy distribution for the particles
escaping from the disk, and we conclude by discussing the spectrum of the

simulations of weakly compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence
(``Alfvenic turbulence''); these results are relevant to particle heating and
acceleration in the solar wind, solar flares, accretion disks onto black holes,
and other astrophysics and heliospheric environments. The physics of particle
heating depends on whether the gyrofrequency of a particle is comparable to the
frequency of a turbulent fluctuation that is resolved on the computational
domain. Particles with these frequencies nearly equal undergo strong
perpendicular heating (relative to the local magnetic field) and pitch angle
scattering. By contrast, particles with large gyrofrequency undergo strong
parallel heating. Simulations with a finite resistivity produce additional
parallel heating due to parallel electric fields in small-scale current sheets.
Many of our results are consistent with linear theory predictions for the
particle heating produced by the Alfven and slow magnetosonic waves that make
up Alfvenic turbulence. However, in contrast to linear theory predictions,
energy exchange is not dominated by discrete resonances between particles and
waves; instead, the resonances are substantially ``broadened.'' We discuss the
implications of our results for solar and astrophysics problems, in particular
the thermodynamics of the near-Earth solar wind. We conclude that Alfvenic

energy cosmic ray particles involves the generation and propagation of a huge
amount of particles. As it is unpractical to follow every particle to its end,
particles below a certain energy ($E_{Cut}$) are discarded from the simulation.
In this article we study in detail the influence that this cut has on the total
energy deposited in the atmosphere by the particle cascade in AIRES
simulations. The energy deposit is directly related to the emission of
fluorescence light and is critical for the accurate simulation of shower
signals in fluorescence detectors. Not correcting for the discarded particles
introduces a bias on several shower observables related to the energy deposit
that can range from 3 to 30% or more depending on the $E_{Cut}$ value used. A
prescription for the correct treatment of these particles is proposed, and the
resulting corrections to the total energy deposit are addressed, including a
new universal parametrization of the mean energy deposit per particle. The low
energy cut is introduced in the simulations to reduce the required CPU time per
shower at the expense of simulation accuracy. We find that a 0.4 MeV cut for
electrons and 0.9 MeV cut for gammas is an adequate compromise, and that the
proposed prescription is capablable of removing the bias introduced by this
cut. The prescription is independent of the energy cut value and can be used to
correct and compare simulations made with different energy cuts.

method. The particle shapes are rounded-cap rectangles characterized by their
elongation. The macroscopic and microstructural properties of several packings
subjected to biaxial compression are analyzed as a function of particle
elongation. We find that the shear strength is an increasing linear function of
elongation. Performing an additive decomposition of the stress tensor based on
a harmonic approximation of the angular dependence of branch vectors, contact
normals and forces, we show that the increasing mobilization of friction force
and the associated anisotropy are key effects of particle elongation. These
effects are correlated with partial nematic ordering of the particles which
tend to be oriented perpendicular to the major principal stress direction and
form side-to-side contacts. However, the force transmission is found to be
mainly guided by cap-to-side contacts, which represent the largest fraction of
contacts for the most elongated particles. Another interesting finding is that,
in contrast to shear strength, the solid fraction first increases with particle
elongation, but declines as the particles become more elongated. It is also
remarkable that the coordination number does not follow this trend so that the
packings of more elongated particles are looser but more strongly connected.

Relative Velocity of Inertial Particles in Turbulent Flows,http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.2419v1,"['Liubin Pan', 'Paolo Padoan']","  We present a model for the relative velocity of inertial particles in
turbulent flows. Our general formulation shows that the relative velocity has
contributions from two terms, referred to as the generalized acceleration and
generalized shear terms, because they reduce to the well known acceleration and
shear terms in the Saffman-Turner limit. The generalized shear term represents
particles' memory of the flow velocity difference along their trajectories and
depends on the inertial particle pair dispersion backward in time. The
importance of this backward dispersion in determining the particle relative
velocity is emphasized. We find that our model with a two-phase separation
behavior, an early ballistic phase and a later tracer-like phase, as found by
recent simulations for the forward (in time) dispersion of inertial particle
pairs, gives good fits to the measured relative speeds from simulations at low
Reynolds numbers. In the monodisperse case with identical particles, the
generalized acceleration term vanishes and the relative velocity is determined
by the generalized shear term. At large Reynolds numbers, our model gives a
$St^{1/2}$ dependence of the relative velocity on the Stokes number $St$ in the
inertial range for both the ballistic behavior and the Richardson separation
law. This leads to the same inertial-range scaling for the two-phase separation
that well fits the simulation results. Our calculations for the bidisperse case
show that, with the friction timescale of one particle fixed, the relative
speed as a function of the other particle's friction time has a dip when the
two timescales are similar. We find that the primary contribution at the dip is
from the generalized shear term, while the generalized acceleration term is
dominant for particles of very different sizes.

amplification of structure in the halo, or shocking as the satellite passes
through the disk of the Galaxy. We measure Jeans wavelengths and growth
timescales in the tidal tail and show that the Jeans instability is a viable
explanation for the clumps. We find that the instability causes velocity
perturbations of order 10 km/s. Clumps in tidal tails present in the Milky Way
could be seen in stellar radial velocity surveys as well as number counts. We
find that the unstable wavelength growth is sensitive to the simulated mass of
dark matter halo particles. A simulation with a smoother halo exhibits colder
and thinner tidal tails with more closely spaced clumps than a simulation with
more massive dark matter halo particles. Heating by the halo particles
increases the Jeans wavelength in the tidal tail affecting substructure
development, suggesting an intricate connection between tidal tails and dark
matter halo substructure.

Anomalous Transport and Nonlinear Reactions in Spiny Dendrites,http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.3621v1,"['Sergei Fedotov', 'Hamed Al-Shamsi', 'Alexey Ivanov', 'Andrey Zubarev']","  We present a \textit{mesoscopic}description of the anomalous transport and
reactions of particles in spiny dendrites. As a starting point we use two-state
Markovian model with the transition probabilities depending on residence time
variable. The main assumption is that the longer a particle survives inside
spine, the smaller becomes the transition probability from spine to dendrite.
We extend a linear model presented in [PRL, \textbf{101}, 218102 (2008)] and
derive the nonlinear Master equations for the average densities of particles
inside spines and parent dendrite by eliminating residence time variable. We
show that the flux of particles between spines and parent dendrite is not local
in time and space. In particular the average flux of particles from a
population of spines through spines necks into parent dendrite depends on
chemical reactions in spines. This memory effect means that one can not
separate the exchange flux of particles and the chemical reactions inside
spines. This phenomenon does not exist in the Markovian case. The flux of
particles from dendrite to spines is found to depend on the transport process
inside dendrite. We show that if the particles inside a dendrite have constant
velocity, the mean particle's position $<x(t)> $ increases as $t^{\mu}$ with
$\mu <1$ (anomalous convection). We derive a fractional convection-diffusion
equation for the total density of particles.

planetesimal formation in turbulence generated by the magnetorotational
instability. We show that the turbulent viscosity associated with
magnetorotational turbulence in a non-stratified shearing box increases when
going from 256^3 to 512^3 grid points in the presence of a weak imposed
magnetic field, yielding a turbulent viscosity of $\alpha\approx0.003$ at high
resolution. Particles representing approximately meter-sized boulders
concentrate in large-scale high-pressure regions in the simulation box. The
appearance of zonal flows and particle concentration in pressure bumps is
relatively similar at moderate (256^3) and high (512^3) resolution. In the
moderate-resolution simulation we activate particle self-gravity at a time when
there is little particle concentration, in contrast with previous simulations
where particle self-gravity was activated during a concentration event. We
observe that bound clumps form over the next ten orbits, with initial birth
masses of a few times the dwarf planet Ceres. At high resolution we activate
self-gravity during a particle concentration event, leading to a burst of
planetesimal formation, with clump masses ranging from a significant fraction
of to several times the mass of Ceres. We present a new domain decomposition
algorithm for particle-mesh schemes. Particles are spread evenly among the
processors and the local gas velocity field and assigned drag forces are
exchanged between a domain-decomposed mesh and discrete blocks of particles. We
obtain good load balancing on up to 4096 cores even in simulations where
particles sediment to the mid-plane and concentrate in pressure bumps.

  Aggregates as a Source of Micrometer-Sized Particles",http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0427v3,"['Rainer Schräpler', 'Jürgen Blum']","  Observed protoplanetary disks consist of a large amount of micrometer-sized
particles. Dullemond and Dominik (2005) pointed out for the first time the
difficulty in explaining the strong mid-IR excess of classical T-Tauri stars
without any dust-retention mechanisms. Because high relative velocities in
between micrometer-sized and macroscopic particles exist in protoplanetary
disks, we present experimental results on the erosion of macroscopic
agglomerates consisting of micrometer-sized spherical particles via the impact
of micrometer-sized particles. We find that after an initial phase, in which an
impacting particle erodes up to 10 particles of an agglomerate, the impacting
particles compress the agglomerate's surface, which partly passivates the
agglomerates against erosion. Due to this effect the erosion halts within our
error bars for impact velocities up to ~30 m/s. For larger velocities, the
erosion is reduced by an order of magnitude. This outcome is explained and
confirmed by a numerical model. In a next step we build an analytical disk
model and implement the experimentally found erosive effect. The model shows
that erosion is a strong source of micrometer-sized particles in a
protoplanetary disk. Finally we use the stationary solution of this model to
explain the amount of micrometer-sized particles in observational infrared data

investigate the dispersion of small inertial particles in turbulent flows is
the accuracy with which particle statistics and concentration can be
reproduced. The motion of particles in LES fields may differ significantly from
that observed in experiments or direct numerical simulation (DNS) because the
force acting on the particles is not accurately estimated, due to the
availability of the only filtered fluid velocity, and because errors accumulate
in time leading to a progressive divergence of the trajectories. This may lead
to different degrees of inaccuracy in the prediction of statistics and
concentration. We identify herein an ideal subgrid correction of the a-priori
LES fluid velocity seen by the particles in turbulent channel flow. This
correction is computed by imposing that the trajectories of individual
particles moving in filtered DNS fields exactly coincide with the particle
trajectories in a DNS. In this way the errors introduced by filtering into the
particle motion equations can be singled out and analyzed separately from those
due to the progressive divergence of the trajectories. The subgrid correction

Reasons for gravitational mass and the problem of quantum gravity,http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.5270v1,['Volodymyr Krasnoholovets'],"  The problem of quantum gravity is treated from a radically new viewpoint
based on a detailed mathematical analysis of what the constitution of physical
space is, which has been carried out by Michel Bounias and the author. The
approach allows the introduction of the notion of mass as a local deformation
of space regarded as a tessellation lattice of founding elements, topological
balls, whose size is estimated as the Planck one. The interaction of a moving
particle-like deformation with the surrounding lattice of space involves a
fractal decomposition process that supports the existence and properties of
previously postulated inerton clouds as associated to particles. The cloud of
inertons surrounding the particle spreads out to a range \Lambda = \lambda c /
v from the particle where v and c are velocities of the particle and light,
respectively, and \lambda is the de Broglie wavelength of the particle. Thus
the particle's inertons return the real sense to the wave \psi-function as the
field of inertia of the moving particle. Since inertons transfer fragments of
the particle mass, they play also the role of carriers of gravitational
properties of the particle. The submicroscopic concept has been verified
experimentally, though so far in microscopic and intermediate ranges.

particle creation for a power law expansion of the scale factor of the form
$t^{2n/3}$ for real scalar particles in a flat and matter dominated universe.
Such an evolution follows from a modified theory of gravity of the type
$f(R)=\beta R^n$, and it is showed that the spectrum of created particles is
$\beta$ independent. We find that greater the value of $n$ smaller is the
number of created particles. We study in detail the spectrum of the total
particle number created for $n=1\pm \varepsilon$, with $\varepsilon = 0.1$, a
very small deviation from the standard general relativity case ($n=1$). We find
that such a very small deviation causes a great difference in the total
particle number, of about one order of magnitude as compared to the standard
general relativity. Our calculations are based on the method of instantaneous
Hamiltonian diagonalization, where the vacuum states are defined as those which
minimizes the energy at a particular instant of time. The spectrum of the total
number and total energy of created particles can be determined exactly for any
value of the physical time in a matter dominated universe. We also find that
the main contribution to the total number of particles and total energy comes
from small wavenumbers $k$ and for particles with large values of $k$ the

Smooth particle methods without smoothing,http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.1859v3,['Martin Campos Pinto'],"  We present a new class of particle methods with deformable shapes that
converge in the uniform norm without requiring remappings, extended overlapping
or vanishing moments for the particles. The crux of the method is to use
polynomial expansions of the backward characteristic flow to transport the
numerical particles with improved accuracy: in the first order case the method
consists of representing the transported density with linearly-transformed
particles, the second order version computes quadratically-transformed
particles, and so on. For programming purposes we provide explicit
implementations of the resulting LTP and QTP schemes that only involve
pointwise evaluations of the forward characteristic flow, and also come with
local indicators for the accuracy of the corresponding transport scheme.
Numerical tests using different transport problems demonstrate the accuracy of
the proposed methods compared to standard particle schemes, and establish their
robustness with respect to the remapping period. In particular, it is shown
that QTP particles can be transported without remappings on very long periods
of times, without hampering the accuracy of the numerical solutions. Finally, a
dynamic criterion is proposed to automatically select the time steps where the
particles should be remapped. The strategy does not require additional
inter-particle communications, and it is validated by numerical experiments.

[1] have revealed the existence of a component of random uncorrelated motion
(RUM)dependent on the particle inertia {\tau}p(normalised particle response
time or Stoke number). This paper reports the presence of RUM in a simple
linear random smoothly varying flow field of counter rotating vortices where
the two-particle velocity correlation was measured as a function of spatial
separation. Values of the correlation less than one for zero separation
indicated the presence of RUM. In terms of Stokes number, the motion of the
particles in one direction corresponds to either a heavily damped ({\tau}p <
0.25) or lightly damped ({\tau}p > 0.25)harmonic oscillator. In the lightly
damped case the particles overshoot the stagnation lines of the flow and are
projected from one vortex to another (the so-called sling-shot effect). It is
shown that RUM occurs only when {\tau}p > 0.25, increasing monotonically with
increasing Stokes number. Calculations of the particle pair separation
distribution function show that equilibrium of the particle concentration field
is never reached, the concentration at zero separation increasing monotonically
with time. This is consistent with the calculated negative values of the
average Liapounov exponent (finite compressibility) of the particle velocity
field.

a robust classifier from a small number of characteristic image features. In

applying it to an experimental cryo-EM dataset and comparing the results to the
manual classification of the same dataset. Comparisons between MAPPOS and

merely a few hundred sample images are sufficient for MAPPOS to classify an

accelerate the throughput of large datasets by reducing the manual workload by
orders of magnitude while maintaining a reliable identification of non-particle

However, gas-solid coupling and the corresponding fluid flow solver remain
immature. In this work, we propose a modified lattice Boltzmann approach to
consider the effect of both the local solid volume fraction and the local

typical fluidization processes, namely, a single bubble injection at incipient
fluidization and particle clustering in a fast fluidized bed riser, are
simulated with this approach, with the results showing a good agreement with
published correlations and experimental data. The capability of the approach to
capture more detailed and intrinsic characteristics of particle-fluid systems

arbitrary time-harmonic wave on an absorbing compressible particle that is
suspended in an inviscid fluid are presented. It is considered that the
particle diameter is much smaller than the incident wavelength, i.e. the
so-called Rayleigh scattering limit. Moreover, the particle absorption assumed
here is due to the attenuation of compressional waves only. Shear waves inside

boundary layer of the particle are supposed to be much smaller than the
particle radius. The obtained radiation force formulas are used to establish
the trapping conditions of a particle by a single-beam acoustical tweezer based

techniques. Particle-production yields, spectral shapes and particle ratios are
measured in several multiplicity classes and are compared with results obtained

momentum spectra and nuclear modification factor R$_{\rm pPb}$ indicates that
the strong suppression of high-$p_{\rm T}$ hadrons observed in Pb-Pb collisions
is not due to initial-state effects, but it is rather a fingerprint of jet
quenching in hot QCD matter. The systematic study of the hadronic spectral
shapes as a function of the particle mass and of particle ratios as a function
of charged-particle density provides insights into collective phenomena, as
observed in Pb-Pb collisions. Similar features, that could be present in

statements are not true for high branching rates. An interesting feature of the

if the branching rate is small enough, then we show that for the process

drag with circum-planetary disk gas in this size regime is most effective. The
efficiency for particles larger than 10m size becomes lower because gas drag
becomes less effective. For particles smaller than 10m, the efficiency is lower
because the particles are strongly coupled with the back-ground gas flow, which
prevent particles from accretion. We also find that the distance from the

points of a Poisson process of intensity $\mu$ and, in each piece, the
Hamiltonian is the Dirichlet Laplacian. The particles interact through a
repulsive pair potential decaying polynomially fast at infinity. We assume that
the particles have a positive density, i.e., $n/|\Lambda|\to\rho>0$ as
$|\Lambda|\to+\infty$. In the low density or large disorder regime, i.e.,
$\rho/\mu$ small, we obtain a two term asymptotic for the thermodynamic limit
of the ground state energy per particle of the interacting system; the first
order correction term to the non interacting ground state energy per particle
is controlled by pairs of particles living in the same piece. The ground state
is described in terms of its one and two-particles reduced density matrix.
Comparing the interacting and the non interacting ground states, one sees that

common to all particles and which is described through the solution of a
stochastic differential equation coupled, through the empirical measures, with
the $N$-particle dynamics. We are interested in the asymptotic behavior as
$N\to \infty$. Although the full system is not exchangeable, particles in the
same population have an exchangeable distribution. Using this structure, one
can prove using standard techniques a law of large numbers result and a
propagation of chaos property. In the current work we study fluctuations about
the law of large number limit. For the case where the common factor is absent
the limit is given in terms of a Gaussian field whereas in the presence of a
common factor it is characterized through a mixture of Gaussian distributions.
We also obtain, as a corollary, new fluctuation results for disjoint
sub-families of single type particle systems, i.e. when $K=1$. Finally, we
establish limit theorems for multi-type statistics of such weakly interacting
particles, given in terms of multiple Wiener integrals.

Collective phenomena in granular and atmospheric electrification,http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04214v2,"['Freja Nordsiek', 'Daniel P. Lathrop']","  In clouds of suspended particles (grains, droplets, spheres, crystals, etc.),
collisions electrify the particles and the clouds, producing large electric
potential differences over large scales. This is seen most spectacularly in the
atmosphere as lighting in thunderstorms, thundersnow, dust storms, and volcanic
ash plumes where multi-million-volt potential differences over scales of
kilometers can be produced, but it is a general phenomenon in granular systems
as a whole. The electrification process is not well understood, especially for
electrification of insulating particles of the same material. To investigate
the relative importances of particle properties (material, size, etc.) and
collective phenomena (behaviors of systems at large scales not easily predicted
from local dynamics) in granular and atmospheric electrification, we used a
table-top experiment that mechanically shakes particles inside a cell where we
measure the macroscopic electric field between the electrically conducting end
plates. The measured electric fields are a result of capacitive coupling and
direct charge transfer between the particles and the plates. Using a diverse
range of mono-material particle sets (plastics, ceramic, glass, and metals), we
found that all our particle materials electrify and show similar dynamics with
long time-scale temporal variation and an electric field amplitude that depends
on the particle quantity in a complex way. These results suggest that while
particle properties do matter like previous investigations have shown,
macroscopic electrification of solids is relatively material agnostic and large
scale collective phenomena play a major role.

  friction showing bounded particle speed",http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.04008v1,['Andreas M. Menzel'],"  Diffusion of colloidal particles in a complex environment such as polymer
networks or biological cells is a topic of high complexity with significant
biological and medical relevance. In such situations, the interaction between
the surroundings and the particle motion has to be taken into account. We
analyze a simplified diffusion model that includes some aspects of a complex
environment in the framework of a nonlinear friction process: at low particle
speeds, friction grows linearly with the particle velocity as for regular
viscous friction; it grows more than linearly at higher particle velocities;
finally, at a maximum of the possible particle speed the friction diverges. In
addition to bare diffusion, we study the influence of a constant drift force
acting on the diffusing particle. While the corresponding stationary velocity
distributions can be derived analytically, the displacement statistics
generally must be determined numerically. However, as a benefit of our model,
analytical progress can be made in one case of a special maximum particle
speed. The effect of a drift force in this case is analytically determined by
perturbation theory. It will be interesting in the future to compare our
results to real experimental systems. One realization could be magnetic
colloidal particles diffusing through a shear-thickening environment such as
starch suspensions, possibly exposed to an external magnetic field gradient.

the driven tracer particle is a nonmonotonic function of the force, so that in
some parameter range the differential mobility becomes negative, and b) the
biased particle drives the whole system into a nonequilibrium steady-state with
a stationary particle density profile past the tracer, which decays
exponentially, in sharp contrast with the behavior observed for unbounded

time and space. Recently, stochastic bedload transport theories have been
developed to address the mechanisms and effects of bedload transport
fluctuations. Stochastic models involve parameters such as particle
diffusivity, entrainment and deposition rates. The lack of hard information on
how these parameters vary with flow conditions is a clear impediment to their
application to real-world scenarios. In this paper, we determined the closure
equations for the above parameters from laboratory experiments. We focused on
shallow supercritical flow on a sloping mobile bed in straight channels, a
setting that was representative of flow conditions in mountain rivers.
Experiments were run at low sediment transport rates under steady nonuniform
flow conditions (i.e., the water discharge was kept constant, but bedforms
developed and migrated upstream, making flow nonuniform). Using image
processing, we reconstructed particle paths to deduce the particle velocity and
its probability distribution, particle diffusivity, and rates of deposition and
entrainment. We found that on average, particle acceleration, velocity and
deposition rate were responsive to local flow conditions, whereas entrainment
rate depended strongly on local bed activity. Particle diffusivity varied
linearly with the depth-averaged flow velocity. The empirical probability
distribution of particle velocity was well approximated by a Gaussian
distribution when all particle positions were considered together. In contrast,
the particles located in close vicinity to the bed had exponentially
distributed velocities. Our experimental results provide closure equations for
stochastic or deterministic bedload transport models.

spatially correlated motion of weakly charged silica spheres at an air-water
interface for different area fraction $n$ occupied by the particles. When the
area fraction is very small, e.g. $n=0.03$, the correlation function along the
line joining the centers of particles $D_{rr}$ decays with inter-particle
distance $R$ as $1/R^{0.86\pm0.02}$, and the function perpendicular to this
line $D_{\theta\theta}$ decays with $R$ as $1/R^{1.45\pm0.03}$, which differs
from the results of [Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 176001 (2006)] with low surface
viscosity (where $D_{rr}\propto 1/R$, $D_{\theta\theta}\propto 1/R^2$). We
argue that the differences arise from the Coulomb interaction between

Experimental results show that with the increase of $n$, the decay rate of
$D_{rr}$ and $D_{\theta\theta}$ with $R$ decreases and the cross-correlation
enhances for the Coulomb interaction increases. The Coulomb interaction between
colloidal particles should serve as an effective surface viscoelastical role in
our system. With the scaled separation $\frac R {d}(\frac {\eta_{w}d}

  reconnection",http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.07349v3,"['Daniel Kagan', 'Ehud Nakar', 'Tsvi Piran']","  Relativistic reconnection has been invoked as a mechanism for particle
acceleration in numerous astrophysical systems. According to idealised
analytical models reconnection produces a bulk relativistic outflow emerging
from the reconnection sites (X-points). The resulting radiation is therefore
highly beamed. Using two-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we
investigate particle and radiation beaming, finding a very different picture.
Instead of having a relativistic average bulk motion with isotropic electron
velocity distribution in its rest frame, we find that the bulk motion of
particles in X-points is similar to their Lorentz factor gamma, and the
particles are beamed within about 5/gamma. On the way from the X-point to the
magnetic islands, particles turn in the magnetic field, forming a fan confined
to the current sheet. Once they reach the islands they isotropise after
completing a full Larmor gyration and their radiation is not strongly beamed
anymore. The radiation pattern at a given frequency depends on where the
corresponding emitting electrons radiate their energy. Lower energy particles
that cool slowly spend most of their time in the islands, and their radiation
is not highly beamed. Only particles that quickly cool at the edge of the
X-points generate a highly beamed fan-like radiation pattern. The radiation
emerging from these fast cooling particles is above the burn-off limit (about
100 MeV in the overall rest frame of the reconnecting plasma.) This has
significant implications for models of GRBs and AGNs that invoke beaming in
that frame at much lower energies.

Capacity Limits of Diffusion-Based Molecular Timing Channels,http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07757v3,"['Nariman Farsad', 'Yonathan Murin', 'Andrew Eckford', 'Andrea Goldsmith']","  This work introduces capacity limits for molecular timing (MT) channels,
where information is modulated in the release timing of small information
particles, and decoded from the time of arrivals at the receiver. It is shown
that the random time of arrival can be represented as an additive noise
channel, and for the diffusion-based MT (DBMT) channel this noise is
distributed according to the L\'evy distribution. Lower and upper bounds on the
capacity of the DBMT channel are derived for the case where the delay
associated with the propagation of the information particles in the channel is
finite, namely, when the information particles dissipate after a finite time
interval. For the case where a single particle is released per channel use,
these bounds are shown to be tight. When the transmitter simultaneously
releases a large number of particles, the detector at the receiver may not be
able to precisely detect the arrival time of all the particles. Therefore, two
alternative models are considered: detection based on the particle that arrives
first, or detection based on the average arrival times. Tight lower and upper
bounds are derived for these two models. It is shown that by controlling the
maximal delay of the information particles, the capacity can increase
poly-logarithmically with the number of released particles. As each particle
takes a random independent path, this diversity of paths is analogous to
receiver diversity and can be used to considerably increase the achievable data
rates.

efficiency is nonmonotonic since the ratcheting is enhanced by increased

weak substrates but increases the ratchet efficiency for strong substrates due
to collective hopping events. At the highest particle densities, the ratchet
motion is destroyed by a self-jamming effect. We show that it is possible to
realize reversals of the ratchet effect, where the net flux of particles is
along the hard rather than the easy direction of the substrate asymmetry. The
reversals occur in the strong substrate limit when multiple rows of active

attachment to the membrane, then particle wrapping, and in rare cases
spontaneous membrane tubulation. In the attached state, we measure that the

vesicle, their initial single-particle state determines their interactions and
subsequent assembly pathways: 1) attached particles only aggregate when small
adhesive vesicles are present in solution, 2) wrapped particles reversibly
attract one another by membrane deformation, and 3) a combination of wrapped

into a variety of complex structures. The experimental observation of distinct

free particle tunneling through a rectangular quantum-mechanical barrier. If
the energy difference between the barrier and the particle is positive, and the
barrier width is large enough, there is proof that the tunneling may be
superluminal. For first spinor components of particle and antiparticle states,
the tunneling is always superluminal regardless the barrier width. Conversely,
the second spinor components of particle and antiparticle states may be either
subluminal or superluminal depending on the barrier width. These results derive
from studying the tunneling time in terms of phase time. For the first spinor
components of particle and antiparticle states, it is always negative while for
the second spinor components of particle and antiparticle states, it is always
positive, whatever the height and width of the barrier. In total, the tunneling
time always remains positive for particle states while it becomes negative for
antiparticle ones. Furthermore, the phase time tends to zero, increasing the
potential barrier both for particle and antiparticle states. This agrees with
the interpretation of quantum tunneling that the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle provides. This study results are innovative with respect to those
available in the literature. Moreover, they show that the superluminal
behaviour of particles occurs in those processes with high-energy confinement.

"Collective phases of identical particles interfering on linear
  multiports",http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03893v3,"['V. S. Shchesnovich', 'M. E. O. Bezerra']","  We introduce collective geometric phases of bosons and fermions interfering
on a linear unitary multiport, where each phase depends on the internal states
of identical particles (i.e., not affected by the multiport) and corresponds to
a cycle of the symmetric group. We show that quantum interference of $N$
particles in generic pure internal states, i.e., with no pair being orthogonal,
is governed by $(N-1)(N-2)/2$ independent triad phases (each involving only
three particles). The deterministic distinguishability, preventing quantum
interference with two or three particles, allows for the genuine $(N\ge
4)$-particle phase (interference) on a multiport: setting each particle to be
deterministically distinguishable from all others except two by their internal
states allows for a novel (circle-dance) interference of $N\ge 4$ particles
governed by a collective $N$-particle phase, while simultaneously preventing
the $R$-particle interference for $3\le R\le N-1$. The genuine $N$-particle
interference manifests the $N$th order quantum correlations between identical
particles at a multiport output, it does not appear in the marginal probability
for a subset of the particles, e.g., it cannot be detected if at least one of
the particles is lost. This means that the collective phases are not detectable
by the usual ""quantumness"" criteria based on the second-order quantum
correlations. The results can be useful for quantum computation, quantum
information, and other quantum technologies with single photons. \end{abstract}

"Small-scale dynamics of settling, bidisperse particles in turbulence",http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00511v1,"['Rohit Dhariwal', 'Andrew D. Bragg']","  We use Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) to investigate the dynamics of
settling, bidisperse particles in isotropic turbulence. In agreement with
previous studies, we find that without gravity (i.e. $Fr=\infty$, where $Fr$ is
the Froude number), bidispersity leads to an enhancement of the relative
velocities, and a suppression of their spatial clustering. For $Fr<1$, the
relative velocities in the direction of gravity are enhanced by the
differential settling velocities of the bidisperse particles, as expected.
However, we also find that gravity can strongly enhance the relative velocities
in the ""horizontal"" directions (i.e. in the plane normal to gravity). This
non-trivial behavior occurs because fast settling particles experience rapid
fluctuations in the fluid velocity field along their trajectory, leading to
enhanced particle accelerations and relative velocities. Indeed, the results
show that even when $Fr\ll1$, turbulence can still play an important role, not
only on the horizontal motion, but also on the vertical motion of the
particles, with significant implications for understanding the mixing rates of
settling bidisperse particles in turbulence. We also find that gravity
drastically reduces the clustering of bidisperse particles. These results are
strikingly different to the monodisperse case, for which recent results have
shown that when $Fr<1$, gravity strongly suppresses the relative velocities in
all directions, and can enhance clustering. We then consider the implications
of these results for the collision rates of settling, bidisperse particles in
turbulence. We find that for $Fr=0.052$, the collision kernel is almost
perfectly predicted by the collision kernel for bidisperse particles settling
in quiescent flow, such that the effect of turbulence may be ignored...

Hawking temperature for the 2+1 dimensional New-type black hole by using the
quantum tunneling method for both the spin-1/2 Dirac and the spin-0 scalar

the black hole, we modified Dirac and Klein-Gordon equations. We observed that
the modified Hawking temperature of the black hole depends not only on the
black hole properties, but also on the graviton mass and the intrinsic
properties of the tunneling particle, such as total angular momentum, energy
and mass. Also, we see that the Hawking temperature was found to be probed by
these particles in different manners. The modified Hawking temperature for the
scalar particle seems to be lower compared to its standard Hawking temperature.
Also, we find that the modified Hawking temperature of the black hole caused by
Dirac particle's tunnelling rised by the total angular momentum of the
particle. It is diminishable by the energy and mass of the particle and
graviton mass as well. These intrinsic properties of the particle, except total
angular momentum for the Dirac particle, and graviton mass may cause screening

the conflict between the RNA polymerase (RNAP) motor traffic, engaged in the
transcription of a segment of DNA, concomitant with the progress of two DNA
replication forks on the same DNA segment. One of the species of particles
($P$) represents RNAP motors while the other ($R$) represents replication
forks. Motivated by the biological phenomena that this model is intended to
capture, a maximum of only two $R$ particles are allowed to enter the lattice
from two opposite ends whereas the unrestricted number of $P$ particles
constitute a totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) in a segment
in the middle of the lattice. Consequently, the lattice consists of three
segments; the encounters of the $P$ particles with the $R$ particles are
confined within the middle segment (segment $2$) whereas only the $R$ particles
can occupy the sites in the segments $1$ and $3$. The model captures three
distinct pathways for resolving the co-directional as well as head-collision
between the $P$ and $R$ particles. Using Monte Carlo simulations and heuristic
analytical arguments that combine exact results for the TASEP with mean-field
approximations, we predict the possible outcomes of the conflict between the
traffic of RNAP motors ($P$ particles engaged in transcription) and the

nonspherical particles can be mechanically stable despite having fewer contacts
than that predicted from na\""ive constraint counting. To generate highly
accurate force- and torque-balanced packings of circulo-lines and -polygons, we
developed an interparticle potential that gives continuous forces and torques
as a function of the particle coordinates. We show that the packing fraction

asphericity ${\cal A}$, which is proportional to the ratio of the squared
perimeter to the area of the particle. Further, the eigenvalue spectra of the
dynamical matrix for packings of different particle shapes collapse when
plotted at the same ${\cal A}$. For hypostatic packings of nonspherical
particles, we verify that the number of ""quartic"" modes along which the
potential energy increases as the fourth power of the perturbation amplitude
matches the number of missing contacts relative to the isostatic value. In
addition, we calculate the principal curvatures of the inequality constraints
for each contact in circulo-line packings and identify specific types of
contacts with inequality constraints that possess convex curvature. These

"Is the use of Christoffel connection in gravity theories conceptually
  correct?",http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02215v1,['Georgios Kofinas'],"  Christoffel connection did not enter gravity as an axiom of minimal length
for the free fall of particles (where anyway length action is not defined for
massless particles), nor out of economy, but from the weak equivalence
principle (gravitational force is equivalent to acceleration according to
Einstein) together with the identification of the local inertial frame with the
local Lorentz one. This identification implies that the orbits of all particles
are given by the geodesics of the Christoffel connection. Here, we show that in
the presence of only massless particles (absence of massive particles) the
above identification is inconsistent and does not lead to any connection. The
proof is based on the existence of projectively equivalent connections and the
absence of proper time for null particles. If a connection derived by some
kinematical principles for the particles is to be applied in the world, it is
better these principles to be valid in all relevant spacetime rather than
different principles to give different connections in different spacetime
regions. Therefore, our result stated above may imply a conceptual
insufficiency of the use of the Christoffel connection in the early universe
where only massless particles are expected to be present (whenever at least
some notions, like orbits, are meaningful), and thus of the total use of this
connection. If in the early universe the notion of a massive particle, which
appears latter in time, cannot be used, in an analogous way in a causally
disconnected high-energy region (maybe deep interior of astrophysical objects
or black holes) the same conclusions could be extracted if only massless

dust particles, with special consideration of the initial size frequency
distribution (SFD) and different evolutionary tracks according to initial orbit
and particle shape. We found that close encounters with planets (mostly
Jupiter) are the dominating factor determining the orbital evolution of dust
particles. Therefore, the lifetimes of cometary dust particles (~250 thousand
years) are shorter than the Poynting-Robertson lifetime, and only a small
fraction of large cometary dust particles can be transferred into orbits with
small values of a. The exceptions are dust particles from 2P/Encke and,
potentially, active asteroids that have little interaction with Jupiter. We
also found that the effect of dust shape, mass density, and SFD were not
critical in the total mass supply rate to the Interplanetary Dust Particle

zodiacal light brightness and SFD around the Earth's orbit. When we incorporate
a population of fluffy aggregates discovered in the Earth's stratosphere and
the coma of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko within the initial ejection, the initial
SFD measured at the comae of comets (67P and 81P/Wild 2) can produce the
observed SFD around the Earth's orbit. Considering the above effects, we
derived the probability of mutual collisions among dust particles within the

of a particle in a confined colloid suspension that exhibits density variations
on the scale length of the particle diameter are not in agreement with the
prediction that the spatial variation in MSD should mimic the spatial variation
in density. The predicted behavior is derived from the expectation that the MSD
of a particle depends on the system density and the assumption that the force
acting on a particle is a point function of position. The experimental data
come from studies of the MSDs of particles in narrow ribbon channels and
between narrowly spaced parallel plates, and from new data, reported herein, of
the radial and azimuthal MSDs of a colloid particle in a dense colloid
suspension confined to a small circular cavity. In each of these geometries a
dense colloid suspension exhibits pronounced density oscillations with spacing
of a particle diameter. We remove the discrepancy between prediction and
experiment using the Fisher-Methfessel interpretation of how local equilibrium
in an inhomogeneous system is maintained to argue that the force acting on a
particle is delocalized over a volume with radius equal to a particle diameter.
Our interpretation has relevance to the relationship between the scale of
inhomogeneity and the utility of translation of the particle MSD into a
position dependent diffusion coefficient, and to the use of a spatially

protoplanetary disks. Nonlinear particle clumping from the SI can trigger
gravitational collapse into planetesimals. To better understand the numerical
robustness of the SI, we perform a suite of vertically-stratified 3D
simulations with fixed physical parameters known to produce strong clumping. We
vary the numerical implementation, namely the computational domain size and the
vertical boundary conditions (vBCs), comparing newly-implemented outflow vBCs
to the previously-used periodic and reflecting vBCs. We find strong particle
clumping by the SI is mostly independent of the vBCs. However, peak particle
densities are higher in larger simulation domains due to a larger particle mass
reservoir. We report SI-triggered zonal flows, i.e., azimuthally-banded radial
variations of gas pressure. These structures have low amplitudes, insufficient
to halt particle radial drift, confirming that particle trapping in gas
pressure maxima is not the mechanism of the SI. We find that outflow vBCs
produce artificially large gas outflow rates at vertical boundaries. However,
the outflow vBCs reduce artificial reflections at vertical boundaries, allowing
more particle sedimentation, and showing less temporal variation and better
convergence with box size. The radial spacing of dense particle filaments is
$\sim0.15$ gas scale heights ($H$) for all vBCs, which sets the feeding zone
for planetesimal growth in self-gravitating simulations. Our results validate
the use of the outflow vBCs in SI simulations, even with vertical boundaries

Both the small and large scale features of the resulting inhomogeneous particle

the advecting viscoelastic flow. We find that particles preferentially
accumulate on thin highly elastic propagating waves and that this effect is
largest for intermediate values of particle inertia. We provide a quantitative
characterization of this phenomenon that allows to relate it to the
accumulation of particles in filamentary highly strained flow regions producing
clusters of correlation dimension close to 1. At larger scales, particles are
found to undergo turbophoretic-like segregation. Indeed, our results indicate a
close relationship between the profiles of particle density and fluid velocity
fluctuations. The large-scale inhomogeneity of the particle distribution is
interpreted in the framework of a model derived in the limit of small, but
finite, particle inertia. The qualitative characteristics of different

increased, the latter is found, however, to slightly reduce the globally

all around the volumetric display and therefore provides a true 3D image that
does not rely on interference effects and remains insensitive to the angle of
observation. The challenge is to control with a high accuracy and at high speed
the trajectory of the particle in three dimensions. Systems that use light to
generate free-space images either in plasma or with a bead are strictly

bidispersity leads to an enhancement of the the mean-square separation over a
significant range of scales. When $|\Delta St|\geq O(1)$, the relative
dispersion is further enhanced by gravity due to the large difference in the
settling velocities of the two particles. However, when $|\Delta St|\ll1$,
gravity suppresses the relative dispersion as the settling velocity
contribution is small, and gravity suppresses the non-local contribution to the

and study both the flatness and the evolution of equal-time correlation
functions, as in coarsening of phase ordering systems. Our studies give clear
evidence for a simple scaling description of the approach to steady state, with
a diverging length scale. An investigation of aging properties reveals that
flatness is nonmonotonic in time with two distinct branches, and that a scaling
description holds for each one.

"Turbulence modulation in channel flow of finite-size spheroidal
  particles",http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01761v1,"['M. Niazi Ardekani', 'L. Brandt']","  We study the effect of particle shape on the turbulence in suspensions of
spheroidal particles at volume fraction $\phi = 10\%$ and show how the
near-wall particle dynamics deeply changes with the particle aspect ratio and
how this affects the global suspension behavior. The turbulence reduces with
the aspect ratio of oblate particles, leading to drag reduction with respect to
the single phase flow for particles with aspect ratio $\mathcal{AR}\leq1/3$,
when the significant reduction in Reynolds shear stress is more than the
compensation by the additional stresses, induced by the solid phase. Oblate
particles are found to avoid the region close to the wall, travelling parallel
to it with small angular velocities, while preferentially sampling high-speed
fluid in the wall region. Prolate particles, also tend to orient parallel to
the wall and avoid its vicinity. Their reluctancy to rotate around spanwise
axis reduce the wall-normal velocity fluctuation of the flow and therefore the
turbulence Reynolds stress similar to oblates; however, they undergo rotations
in wall-parallel planes which increases the additional solid stresses due to
their relatively larger angular velocities compared to the oblates. These
larger additional stresses compensates for the reduction in turbulence activity
and leads to a wall-drag similar to that of single-phase flows. Spheres on the
other hand, form a layer close to the wall with large angular velocities in
spanwise direction, which increases the turbulence activity in addition to
exerting the largest solid stresses on the suspension, in comparison to the
other studied shapes. Spherical particles therefore increase the wall-drag with
respect to the single-phase flow.

Dynamic bridging of proppant particles in a hydraulic fracture,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09546v1,"['Igor A. Garagash', 'Andrei A. Osiptsov', 'Sergei A. Boronin']","  This work is focused on the development of a dynamic criterion for the
arching and bridging of spherical particles in a 3D suspension flow through a
channel with plane walls. Elasticity of the particles and the channel walls are
taken into account. The carrier fluid is viscous and incompressible. Bridging
occurs under the balance of the hydrodynamic force exerted from the fluid on
the particles and the friction force exerted from the walls on the particles.
The 3D motion of particles in fluid is analyzed by means of direct numerical
simulation. The bridging criterion is formulated as a domain on the plane in
terms of the two nondimensional parameters: the particle size to channel width
ratio and the flow velocity. For each scaled particle diameter there is a range
of critical velocities, in which bridging occurs. Various geometrical
configurations are considered: three and four particles across the slot.
Stability of the bridge is studied. The dynamic bridging criterion is different
from the earlier purely kinematic criteria, which were formulated in terms of
the particle-to-channel width ratio only. The bridging criterion is implemented
into the 2D width-averaged lubrication model of suspension flow through a plane
channel, and illustrative simulations are conducted. Application is for
proppant transport in hydraulic fractures.

Experimentally, a cavitation bubble was generated with an electric spark near a
solid surface, and its interaction with hard particles of different sizes and

approach was developed to model the behavior of the particles near the bubble
interface during its collapse. Computationally, we simulated an air bubble that
grew and collapsed near a solid wall while interacting with one particle near
the bubble interface. Several simulations with different conditions were made

  learning",http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10880v1,"['Jingran Qiu', 'Lihao Zhao', 'Chunxiao Xu', 'Yichen Yao']","  Motile microorganisms in aquatic ecosystems are able to sense the surrounding
environment and adjust their motion to reach certain regions that are
favourable for their growth or reproduction. Studying the moving strategies of
microorganisms is important for an in-depth understanding of their behaviour in
aquatic environment. In present work, we model microorganisms as smart swimming
particles and introduce reinforcement learning to investigate the strategy for
moving upward in a two-dimensional flow field. We explore how gravity and
elongation of a particle affect the strategies obtained by reinforcement
learning and compared with naive gyrotactic particles. We examine the
micro-swimmers with different motilities (quick-alignment and slow-alignment).
Under the same conditions of quick-alignment motility and flow configuration
multi-solutions of swimming strategy are observed in the case of smart
particles trained by reinforcement learning. However, the multi-solutions are
converged into an almost optimal strategy with inclusion of gravity, which acts
as a constraint on particle motion. Moreover, the elongation of particle is
found to enhance the ability of particle in sampling the low vorticity and
upwelling region. When the settling and elongation are both considered for
slow-alignment particles, similar performance of moving upward is observed for
both smart and naive particles. The interesting findings indicate that the
diversity of proper strategies is restricted with including constraints of more
realistic factors and we suspect that the elongation and gyotaxis of
microorganism might be an almost optimal strategy for swimming upwards after
the long term natural selection. Additionally, the current work on the swimming
strategies of more realistic particles reveals the effectiveness of
reinforcement learning in the study of the behaviour of microorganisms in fluid

A model for inertial particles in curvilinear flows,http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12532v1,"['Mike Garcia', 'Sumita Pennathur']","  The recent advent of advanced microfabrication capabilities of microfluidic
devices has driven attention towards the behavior of particles in inertial
flows within microchannels for applications related to the separation and
concentration of bio-particles. The phenomena of inertial focusing has been
demonstrated to be a robust technique in such applications, where the flow of
particles in a curvilinear geometry has proven to be particularly advantageous,
not only because the geometry can reduce the foot-print of a lab-on-chip
device, but also because the coupling of secondary Dean flows to inertial
forces allows for exquisite particle manipulations. However, the ability to
design a curvilinear channel for a specific application is often based on
empirical results, as theoretical models to date typically do not include the
effects of a finite sized particle within the flow. Here we present a complete
numerical model that directly simulates a particle within a confide curvilinear
flow and using this model we investigate the three dimensional focusing
behavior of inertial particles as well as the applicability of the point
particle assumptions previous researchers have proposed. Finally, we propose a
new model that takes into account the full physics, but relies on a
perturbation expansion of the lateral forces, where the perturbation parameter
is the curvature ratio of the channel. This simple model can be used to predict
the behavior of particles in complex channel geometries where the curvature may
not be constant.

On Spatial Matchings: The First-in-First-Match case,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03275v3,['Mayank Manjrekar'],"  In this paper, we describe a process where two types of particles, marked by
the colors red and blue, arrive in a domain $D$ at a constant rate and are to
be matched to each other according to the following scheme. At the time of
arrival of a particle, if there are particles of opposite color in the system
within a distance one from the new particle, then, among these particles, it
matches to the one that had arrived the earliest. In this case, both the
matched particles are removed from the system. Otherwise, if there are no
particles within a distance one at the time of the arrival, the particle gets
added to the systems and stays there until it matches with another point later.
Additionally, a particle may depart from the system on its own at a constant
rate, $\mu>0$, due to a loss of patience. We study this process both when $D$
is a compact metric space and when it is a Euclidean domain, $\mathbb{R}^d$,
$d\geq 1$.
  When $D$ is compact, we give a product form characterization of the steady
state probability distribution of the process. We also prove an FKG type
inequality, which establishes certain clustering properties of the red and blue
particles in the steady state. When $D$ is the whole Euclidean space, we use
the time ergodicity of the construction scheme to prove the existence of a
stationary regime.

behaviors such as shear thickening and shear jamming. Shear thickening is known
to be enhanced by increasing the particles' frictional interactions and also by
making their shape more anisotropic. For shear jamming, however, only the role
of interparticle friction has been investigated, while the effect of changing
particle shape has so far not been studied systematically. To address this we
here synthesize smooth silica particles and design the particle surface
chemistry to generate strong frictional interactions such that dense, aqueous
suspensions of spheres exhibit pronounced shear jamming. We then vary particle
aspect ratio from $\Gamma$=1 (spheres) to $\Gamma$=11 (slender rods), and
perform rheological measurements to determine the effect of particle anisotropy
on the onset of shear jamming and its precursor, discontinuous shear
thickening. Keeping the frictional interactions fixed, we find that increasing
aspect ratio significantly reduces $\phi_m$, the minimum particle packing
fraction at which shear jamming can be observed, to values as low $\phi_m=33\%$
for $\Gamma$=11. The ability to independently control particle interactions due
to friction and shape anisotropy yields fundamental insights about the
thickening and jamming capabilities of suspensions and provides a framework to
rationally design shear jamming characteristics.

Method (DEM) simulations on two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) assemblies
show that particle rotations are diverse, that they increase with strain until
the material begins to soften, and that they are expressed in spatial patterns,
even at small strains. The interactions of a pair of particles are a
combination of three modes: a contact deformation mode, a contact rolling mode,
and a mode of rigid pair motions. Definitions are presented for each mode,
including four different definitions of contact rolling. A rolling curl is also
defined, which describes the cumulative rolling of neighboring particles around
a central particle or sub-region. At a larger scale, material deformation and
rotation are measured within small sub-regions of material, and the material
deformation can be attributed to separate contributions of contact rolling,
contact deformation, and the rigid-rotation of particle pairs. The diversity

oblate nematic LCs incorporating particles with the same infinite-dilution
translational or rotational diffusion coefficients. Under these conditions,
which are benchmarked against the standard case of identical aspect ratios, we
observe that prolate particles display faster dynamics than oblate particles at
short and long timescales. Nevertheless, when compared at identical
infinite-dilution translational diffusion coefficients, oblate particles are
faster than their prolate counterparts at short-to-intermediate timescales,
which extend over almost three time decades. Both oblate and prolate particles
exhibit an anisotropic diffusion with respect to the orientation of the nematic
director. More specifically, prolate particles show a fast diffusion in the
direction parallel to the nematic director, while their diffusion in the
direction perpendicular to it is slower. By contrast, the diffusion of oblate
particles is faster in the plane perpendicular to the nematic director.
Finally, in the light of our recent study on the long-time Gaussian and Fickian
diffusion in nematic LCs, we map the decay of the autocorrelation functions and
their fluctuations over the timescales of our simulations to ponder the

accurately. The proposed numerical model is compared with data from wind tunnel
experiments of heavy particle deposition over topography and is found to have
good agreement with observed deposition patterns. An LES case study of snow
deposition over idealized topography leads to several new insights. Particle
inertia leads to relative velocities between the particles and fluid in regions
of mean flow acceleration, thereby enhancing deposition on the windward side of
obstacles and suppressing deposition on the leeward side. In addition, it is
found that the mean components of particle inertia are a factor of 6 or more
larger than the turbulent components, indicating that the

different histories. We discuss this phenomena, here called the TASEP Speed
Process, in an approximate effective medium description, in which the second

practical implications in a number of scientific and engineering problems. In a
quiescent fluid, a slowly settling particle orients so that it settles with its
broad side first. This is an effect of the torque due to convective inertia of
the fluid set in motion by the settling particle, which maximises the drag
experienced by the particle. Turbulent flows tend to randomise the particle
orientation. Recently the settling of non-spherical particles in turbulence was
analysed neglecting the effect of convective fluid inertia, but taking into
account the effect of the turbulent fluid-velocity gradients on the particle
orientation. These studies reached the opposite conclusion, namely that a rod
settles preferentially with its tip first, wheras a disk settles with its edge
first, therefore minimizing the drag on the particle. Here, we consider both
effects, the convective inertial torque as well as the torque due to
fluctuating velocity gradients, and ask under which circumstances either one or
the other dominate. To this end we estimate the ratio of the magnitudes of the
two torques. Our estimates suggest that the fluid-inertia torque prevails in
high-Reynolds number flows. In this case non-spherical particles are expected
to settle with a maximal drag. But when the Reynolds number is small then the
torque due to fluid-velocity gradients may dominate, causing the particle to

expansion coefficient larger than that of the fluid, causing particles to
become lighter than the fluid near the hot bottom plate and heavier than the
fluid near the cold top plate. Because of the opposite directions of the net
Archimedes' force on particles and fluid, particles deposited at the plate now
experience a relative force towards the bulk. The characteristic time for this
motion towards the bulk to happen, quantified as the time particles spend
inside the thermal boundary layers (BLs) at the plates, is shown to depend on
the thermal response time, $\tau_T$, and the thermal expansion coefficient of
particles relative to that of the fluid, $K = \alpha_p / \alpha_f$. In
particular, the residence time is constant for small thermal response times,
$\tau_T \lesssim 1$, and increasing with $\tau_T$ for larger thermal response
times, $\tau_T \gtrsim 1$. Also, the thermal BL residence time is increasing
with decreasing $K$. A one-dimensional (1D) model is developed, where particles
experience thermal inertia and their motion is purely dependent on the buoyancy

  of a Double Power Law Feature in Particle Energy Spectra",http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13321v1,"['Xiangliang Kong', 'Fan Guo', 'Yao Chen', 'Joe Giacalone']","  We present numerical modelling of particle acceleration at coronal shocks
propagating through a streamer-like magnetic field by solving the Parker
transport equation with spatial diffusion both along and across the magnetic
field. We show that the location on the shock where the high-energy particle
intensity is the largest, depends on the energy of the particles and on time.
The acceleration of particles to more than 100 MeV mainly occurs in the
shock-streamer interaction region, due to perpendicular shock geometry and the
trapping effect of closed magnetic fields. A comparison of the particle spectra
to that in a radial magnetic field shows that the intensity at 100 MeV (200
MeV) is enhanced by more than one order (two orders) of magnitude. This
indicates that the streamer-like magnetic field can be an important factor in
producing large solar energetic particle events. We also show that the energy
spectrum integrated over the simulation domain consists of two different power
laws. Further analysis suggests that it may be a mixture of two distinct
populations accelerated in the streamer and open field regions, where the
acceleration rate differs substantially. Our calculations also show that the
particle spectra are affected considerably by a number of parameters, such as
the streamer tilt angle, particle spatial diffusion coefficient, and shock
compression ratio. While the low-energy spectra agree well with standard
diffusive shock acceleration theory, the break energy ranges from $\sim$1 MeV
to $\sim$90 MeV and the high-energy spectra can extend to $\sim$1 GeV with a
slope of $\sim$2-3.

dominated by the highly energetic Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) primary protons,

Escape of Flare-accelerated Particles in Solar Eruptive Events,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13578v1,"['S. Masson', 'S. K. Antiochos', 'C. R. DeVore']","  Impulsive solar energetic particle events are widely believed to be due to
the prompt escape into the interplanetary medium of flare-accelerated particles
produced by solar eruptive events. According to the standard model for such
events, however, particles accelerated by the flare reconnection should remain
trapped in the flux rope comprising the coronal mass ejection. The particles
should reach the Earth only much later, along with the bulk ejecta. To resolve
this paradox, we have extended our previous axisymmetric model for the escape
of flare-accelerated particles to fully three-dimensional (3D) geometries. We
report the results of magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a coronal system that
consists of a bipolar active region embedded in a background global dipole
field structured by solar wind. Our simulations show that multiple magnetic
reconnection episodes occur prior to and during the CME eruption and its
interplanetary propagation. In addition to the episodes that build up the flux
rope, reconnection between the open field and the CME couples the closed corona
to the open interplanetary field. Flare-accelerated particles initially trapped
in the CME thereby gain access to the open interplanetary field along a trail
blazed by magnetic reconnection. A key difference between these 3D results and
our previous calculations is that the interchange reconnection allows
accelerated particles to escape from deep within the CME flux-rope. We estimate
the spatial extent of the particle-escape channels. The relative timings
between flare acceleration and release of the energetic particles through
CME/open-field coupling are also determined. All our results compare favourably
with observations.

their high accuracy and excellent stability, yet their high stiffness and high
temperature fabrication process limits their use in flexible electronics. Here,
a low stiffness thermistor based on NTC ceramic particles of micron size

particle-to-particle contact on electrical performance is studied by arranging
the NTC particles in the composite films in one of three ways: 1) Low particle
contact, 2) Improved particle contact perpendicular to the electrodes and 3)
dispersing high particle contact agglomerated clumps throughout the polymer. At

Reaction processes among self-propelled particles,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11846v1,"['Fernando Peruani', 'Gustavo Sibona']","  We study a system of self-propelled disks that perform run-and-tumble motion,
where particles can adopt more than one internal state. One of those internal
states can be transmitted to another particle if the particle carrying this
state maintains physical contact with another particle for a finite period of
time. We refer to this process as a reaction process and to the different
internal states as particle species making an analogy to chemical reactions.
The studied system may fall into an absorbing phase, where due to the
disappearance of one of the particle species no further reaction can occur or
remain in an active phase where particles constantly react. Combining
individual-based simulations and mean-field arguments, we study the dependence
of the equilibrium densities of particle species with motility parameters,

that the equilibrium densities of particle species exhibit two very distinct,
non-trivial scaling regimes with $v_0$ and $\lambda$ depending on whether the
system is in the so-called ballistic or diffusive regime. Our mean-field
estimates lead to an effective renormalization of reaction rates that allow
building the phase-diagram $v_0$--$\lambda$ that separates the absorbing and

estimates. This study is a necessary step to an understanding of phase
transitions into an absorbing state in active systems and sheds light on the

"Asymptotic analysis of chaotic particle sedimentation and trapping in
  the vicinity of a vertical upward streamline",http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.4157v1,['J. R. Angilella'],"  The sedimentation of a heavy Stokes particle in a laminar plane or
axisymmetric flow is investigated by means of asymptotic methods. We focus on
the occurrence of Stommel's retention zones, and on the splitting of their
separatrices. The goal of this paper is to analyze under which conditions these
retention zones can form, and under which conditions they can break and induce
chaotic particle settling. The terminal velocity of the particle in still fluid
is of the order of the typical velocity of the flow, and the particle response
time is much smaller than the typical flow time-scale. It is observed that if
the flow is steady and has an upward streamline where the vertical velocity has
a strict local maximum, then inertialess particle trajectories can take locally
the form of elliptic Stommel cells, provided the particle terminal velocity is
close enough to the local peak flow velocity. These structures only depend on
the local flow topology and do not require the flow to have closed streamlines
or stagnation points. If, in addition, the flow is submitted to a weak
time-periodic perturbation, classical expansions enable one to write the
particle dynamics as a hamiltonian system with one degree of freedom, plus a
perturbation containing both the dissipative terms of the particle motion
equation and the flow unsteadiness. Melnikov's method therefore provides
accurate criteria to predict the splitting of the separatrices of the elliptic
cell mentioned above, leading to chaotic particle trapping and chaotic
settling. The effect of particle inertia and flow unsteadiness on the
occurrence of simple zeros in Melnikov's function is discussed. Particle motion
in a plane cellular flow and in a vertical pipe is then investigated to
illustrate these results.

Theory of Infinitely Extended Particles,http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.2863v1,['Seyyed Mahmoud Hessaby'],"  The difficulties with which the concept of point-like particles is beset,
such as the infinities encountered in the existing theories of elementary
particles, suggest a different approach to the study of these particles.
Instead of restricting ourselves to the concept of point-like particles, we
should extend our investigation to the implication of the concept of particles
having infinite extension. Such a particle should consist of a continuous
distribution of energy over all space, the energy density tending to zero at
infinity. To achieve this aim, we introduce into the theory of general
relativity the postulate that the gravitational, electric and nuclear fields
are special cases of a more general field. An expression is obtained for the
gravitational potential which differs from the usual expression of the
potential accepted in general relatvity, and which gives an energy density for
the particle at every point of space, the integral of which over all space is
equal to the mass of the particle, the greatest part of the mass being
concentrated near the center of the spherical pattern constituting the
particle. The particle is thus seen to consist of the energy of its field. No
infinities are encountered in the integrations. The same result is obtained for
a charged particle. The charge density is spread out over all space and the
integrals of the charge density and energy density are respectively equal to
the charge and mass of the particle. The electric potential this obtained is
inserted in Dirac's wave equation, and gives a series of equations of
increasing degree, the first of which gives the mass of the muon. When inserted
in Dirac's wave equation, this potential gives the values of the masses of
baryons. When inserted in the Klein-Gordon equation, this potential gives the
values of the masses of mesons.

established symmetric solutions to the Dirac equation that describe a fermionic
particle that is its own anti-particle. This work has long had a significant
impact in neutrino physics, where this fundamental question regarding the
particle remains unanswered. But the formalism he developed has found many uses
as there are now a number of candidate spin-1/2 neutral particles that may be
truly neutral with no quantum number to distinguish them from their
anti-particles. If such particles exist, they will influence many areas of
nuclear and particle physics. Most notably the process of neutrinoless double
beta decay can only exist if neutrinos are massive Majorana particles. Hence,
many efforts to search for this process are underway. Majorana's influence
doesn't stop with particle physics, however, even though that was his original

they describe electronic states in materials with superconducting order. Of
special interest here is the class of solutions of the Majorana equation in one

Tiny particles of joined triangular shape in each case developed under set
tuned ratio of bipolar pulses OFF to ON time. At unipolar pulse, tiny particles
in triangular shape developed directly. When the ratio of bipolar pulse OFF to
ON time was large, distorted shapes of the particles developed. Geometrical
shapes of particles developed under significant ratios of pulse OFF to ON
times. When the ratio of bipolar pulse OFF to ON time was 3, particles
developed in low aspect ratio. But under the fraction of this ratio, particles
tend to develop in high aspect ratio. For longer pulse ON time, structures of

studying the Pluto hazes can shed light on the similarities and differences
between the Pluto and Titan atmospheres. We model the haze distribution using
the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres assuming that the
distribution is shaped by sedimentation and coagulation of particles
originating from photochemistry. Hazes composed of both purely spherical and
purely fractal aggregate particles are considered. Agreement between model
results and occultation observations is obtained with aggregate particles when
the downward flux of photochemical products is equal to the column-integrated
methane destruction rate ~1.2 $\times$ 10$^{-14}$ g cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, while
for spherical particles the mass flux must be 2-3 times greater. This flux is
nearly identical to the haze production flux of Titan previously obtained by
comparing microphysical model results to Cassini observations. The aggregate
particle radius is sensitive to particle charging, and a particle charge to
radius ratio of 30 e-/{\mu}m is necessary to produce ~0.1-0.2 {\mu}m aggregates
near Pluto's surface, in accordance with forward scattering measurements. Such
a particle charge to radius ratio is 2-4 times higher than those previously
obtained for Titan. Hazes composed of spheres with the same particle charge to

suggest that the haze particles are fractal aggregates. We also consider the

"Scattering of EM waves by many small perfectly conducting or impedance
  bodies",http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02060v1,['A. G. Ramm'],"  A theory of electromagnetic (EM) wave scattering by many small particles of
an arbitrary shape is developed. The particles are perfectly conducting or
impedance. For a small impedance particle of an arbitrary shape an explicit
analytical formula is derived for the scattering amplitude. The formula holds
as $a\to 0$, where $a$ is a characteristic size of the small particle and the
wavelength is arbitrary but fixed. The scattering amplitude for a small
impedance particle is shown to be proportional to $a^{2-\kappa}$, where
$\kappa\in [0,1)$ is a parameter which can be chosen by an experimenter as
he/she wants. The boundary impedance of a small particle is assumed to be of
the form $\zeta=ha^{-\kappa}$, where $h=$const, Re$h\ge 0$. The scattering
amplitude for a small perfectly conducting particle is proportional to $a^3$,
it is much smaller than that for the small impedance particle. The many-body
scattering problem is solved under the physical assumptions $a\ll d\ll
\lambda$, where $d$ is the minimal distance between neighboring particles and
$\lambda$ is the wavelength. The distribution law for the small impedance
particles is $\mathcal{N}(\delta)\sim\int_{\delta}N(x)dx$ as $a\to 0$. Here
$N(x)\ge 0$ is an arbitrary continuous function that can be chosen by the
experimenter and $\mathcal{N}(\delta)$ is the number of particles in an
arbitrary sub-domain $\Delta$. It is proved that the EM field in the medium
where many small particles, impedance or perfectly conducting, are distributed,
has a limit, as $a\to 0$ and a differential equation is derived for the
limiting field. On this basis the recipe is given for creating materials with a
desired refraction coefficient by embedding many small impedance particles into

show that the refraction of self-generated waves resulting from the

changes the shape of particle spectrum near the cut-off. The implications for

Power and energy spectra of the charged particles depend on the strength of the

Generalized Galilei-Invariant Classical Mechanics,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0605169v1,"['Harry Woodcock', 'Peter Havas']","  To describe the ``slow'' motions of n interacting mass points, we give the

Galilei group. The resulting 4-d equations of motion and multiple-time
conserved quantities involve integrals over the world lines of the other n-1

Dust accretion onto high-mass planets,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0610675v1,['S. -J. Paardekooper'],"  We study the accretion of dust particles of various sizes onto embedded
massive gas giant planets, where we take into account the structure of the gas
disk due to the presence of the planet. The accretion rate of solids is
important for the structure of giant planets: it determines the growth rate of
the solid core that may be present as well as their final enrichment in solids.
We use the RODEO hydrodynamics solver to solve the flow equations for the gas,
together with a particle approach for the dust. The solver for the particles'
equations of motion is implicit with respect to the drag force, which allows us
to treat the whole dust size spectrum. We find that dust accretion is limited
to the smallest particle sizes. The largest particles get trapped in outer
mean-motion resonances with the planet, while particles of intermediate size
are pushed away from the orbit of the planet by the density structure in the
gas disk. Only particles smaller than approximately s_max =10 micron may
accrete on a planet with the mass of Jupiter. For a ten times less massive
planet s_max=100 micron. The strongly reduced accretion of dust makes it very
hard to enrich a newly formed giant planet in solids.

detectors to defeat much higher-rate backgrounds due to radioactivity and other

fiducial volumes and distinguish nuclear-recoil signal events from
electron-recoil backgrounds, based on the timing, energy density, and/or the
division of the energy into signals of ionization, scintillation, or phonons. I

observation that segregation occurs if the viscous length scale introduced by a
liquid in the system is smaller than of the order of the particle size. We show
that the ratio of shear rate to viscosity must be small if one wants to find
size segregation. In this case the particles in the system arrange themselves
in bands of big and small particles oriented along the direction of the flow.
Similarly, in Poiseuille flow we find the formation of particle bands. Here, in
addition, the variety of time scales in the flow leads to an aggregation of
particles in the zones of low shear rate and can suppress size segregation in
these regions. The results have been verified against simulations using a full

segregation process of binary particle mixtures in three-dimensional rotating

and we focus on different volume filling fractions of the drum to study the
interplay between the competing phenomena of mixing and segregation. It is
found that segregation is best for a more than half-filled drum due to the
non-zero width of the fluidized layer. For different particle size ratios, it
is found that radial segregation occurs for any arbitrary small particle size
difference and the final amount of segregation shows a linear dependence on the
size ratio of the two particle species. To quantify the interplay between
segregation and mixing, we investigate the dynamics of the center of mass
positions for each particle component. Starting with initially separated
particle groups we find that no mixing of the component is necessary in order

coefficients (anomalous velocity and diffusion constant) are strongly dependent

shown that the average one-particle front for the edge particles does not
shrink when N becomes very large, as contrasted to the pure (non-disordered)

front, which can even have infinite mean and variance. On the other hand, it is
shown that the central particle, dynamically trapped by all others as it is,
follows a narrow distribution, which is a Gaussian (with a diffusion constant
scaling as $N^{-1}$) when the fractional moment $<D^{-1/2}>$ exists and is

similar for both types of particles and, for some energy spectra, exhibits
features specific to multiple-step Bose-Einstein condensation, for instance the
appearance of maxima in the specific heat.
  In the case of fermions, as the particle density increases, another
phenomenon is also observed. For certain types of single particle hamiltonians,
the specific heat is approaching asymptotically a divergent behavior at zero
temperature, as the Fermi energy $\epsilon_{\rm F}$ is converging towards any
value from an infinite discrete set of energies: ${\epsilon_i}_{i\ge 1}$. If
$\epsilon_{\rm F}=\epsilon_i$, for any i, the specific heat is divergent at T=0

approaches zero at low enough temperatures. The results are particularized for

Observations of the evolution of particle velocities over time reveal distinct

two particles at a given distance $r$ from the moving wall reveals a
characteristic lengthscale over which the particles are correlated. The
autocorrelation of a single particle's velocity reveals a characteristic
timescale $\tau$ which decreases with distance from the inner moving wall. This

occur and the reduced duration of those events at large $r$. The relationship

strong anchoring create a hedgehog director configuration on the particle
surface and in its vicinity; this topological defect is cancelled by nearby
defect structures in the surrounding liquid crystal, so as to give a uniform
director field at large distances. We observe three defect structures for
different particle sizes: a quadrupolar one with a ring defect surrounding the
particle in the equatorial plane; a dipolar one with a satellite defect at the
north or south pole; and a transitional, non-equatorial, ring defect. These
observations are broadly consistent with the predictions of the simplest
elastic theory. By studying density and order-parameter maps, we are able to
examine behaviour near the particle surface, and in the disclination core
region, where the elastic theory is inapplicable. Despite the relatively small
scale of the inhomogeneities in our systems, the simple theory gives reasonably
accurate predictions of the variation of defect position with particle size.

Monolayer Spreading on a Chemically Heterogeneous Substrate,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0204551v1,"['N. Pesheva', 'G. Oshanin']","  We study the spreading kinetics of a monolayer of hard-core particles on a
semi-infinite, chemically heterogeneous solid substrate, one side of which is
coupled to a particle reservoir. The substrate is modeled as a square lattice
containing two types of sites -- ordinary ones and special, chemically active
sites placed at random positions with mean concentration $\alpha$. These
special sites temporarily immobilize particles of the monolayer which then
serve as impenetrable obstacles for the other particles. In terms of a
mean-field-type theory, we show that the mean displacement $X_0(t)$ of the
monolayer edge grows with time $t$ as $X_0(t) = \sqrt{2 D_{\alpha} t \ln(4
D_{\alpha} t/\pi a^2)}$, ($a$ being the lattice spacing). This time dependence
is confirmed by numerical simulations; $D_{\alpha}$ is obtained numerically for
a wide range of values of the parameter $\alpha$ and trapping times of the
chemically active sites.
  We also study numerically the behavior of a stationary particle current in
finite samples. The question of the influence of attractive particle-particle
interactions on the spreading kinetics is also addressed.

Quasi-particles and their absence in photoemission spectroscopy,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0211098v1,['J. W. Allen'],"  The elucidation of Landau Fermi liquid quasi-particles and their absence in
strongly correlated electron systems lies at the heart of modern research on

spectroscopy of the single particle spectral function is a central experimental

Fermi level resonance associated with the Kondo physics of the Anderson
impurity model, an effective self consisent version of which is utilized in
dynamic mean field theories of general lattice systems which may or may not
literally display Kondo physics. A general paradigm of quasi-particle absence
is the Luttinger liquid physics of the Tomonaga-Luttinger model. This paper

photoemission spectra, taken from the work of the author and his collaborators,
of quasi-particle formation in impurity and lattice Kondo and non-Kondo
correlated electron systems, contrasted with quasi-particle absence in a

confined to the region near and in the scattering particles, and that little
energy concentrates in the fields between particles. Gain was added to the ZnO
system by adding a resonant term having Lorentzian line shape with a negative
coefficient, which drives the imaginary part of the dielectric constant
negative corresponding to gain. With gain in the system, the losses can be
compensated; however, localization and loss compensation (which leads to a

Dipolar Particles in General Relativity,http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0609121v3,['Luc Blanchet'],"  The dynamics of ""dipolar particles"", i.e. particles endowed with a
four-vector mass dipole moment, is investigated using an action principle in
general relativity. The action is a specific functional of the particle's world
line, and of the dipole moment vector, considered as a dynamical variable. The
first part of the action is inspired by that of a particle with spin moving on
an arbitrary gravitational background. The second part is intended to describe,
at some effective level, the internal non-gravitational force linking together
the ""microscopic"" constituents of the dipole. We find that some solutions of
the equations of motion and evolution of the dipolar particles correspond to an
equilibrium state for the dipole moment in a gravitational field. Under some
hypothesis we show that a fluid of dipolar particles, supposed to constitute
the dark matter, reproduces the modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) in the non
relativistic limit. We recover the main characteristics of a recently proposed
quasi-Newtonian model of ""gravitational polarization"".

theory requires the spin $s$ to be an integer or half integer number, thus
implying a quantization condition on the physical mass $M$ of the particle.
Then, standard quantization techniques show that the corresponding Hilbert

Therefore this geometrical particle model provides us with an unified

The Concept of Particle Weights in Local Quantum Field Theory,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0005057v1,['Martin Porrmann'],"  The concept of particle weights has been introduced by Buchholz and the
author in order to obtain a unified treatment of particles as well as (charged)
infraparticles which do not permit a definition of mass and spin according to
Wigner's theory. Particle weights arise as temporal limits of physical states
in the vacuum sector and describe the asymptotic particle content. Following a
thorough analysis of the underlying notion of localizing operators, we give a
precise definition of this concept and investigate the characteristic
properties. The decomposition of particle weights into pure components which
are linked to irreducible representations of the quasi-local algebra has been a
long-standing desideratum that only recently found its solution. We set out two
approaches to this problem by way of disintegration theory, making use of a
physically motivated assumption concerning the structure of phase space in
quantum field theory. The significance of the pure particle weights ensuing
from this disintegration is founded on the fact that they exhibit features of
improper energy-momentum eigenstates, analogous to Dirac's conception, and
permit a consistent definition of mass and spin even in an infraparticle
situation.

leads to its helicity, the two translational degrees of freedom correspond to
its gauge degrees of freedom. It is shown that the E(2)-like symmetry of of
massless particles can be obtained as an infinite-momentum and/or zero-mass
limit of the O(3)-like symmetry of massive particles. This mechanism is
illustrated in terms of a sphere elongating into a cylinder. In this way, the

are discussed in detail. In this approach infinities cannot exist, the
cosmological constant problem does not arise and one irreducible representation
of the symmetry algebra necessarily describes a particle and its antiparticle
simultaneously. As a consequence, well known results of the standard theory
(spin-statistics theorem; a particle and its antiparticle have the same masses
and spins but opposite charges etc.) can be proved without involving local
covariant equations. The spin-statistics theorem is simply a requirement that
quantum theory should be based on complex numbers. Some new features of GFQT
are as follows: i) elementary particles cannot be neutral; ii) the Dirac vacuum
energy problem has a natural solution and the vacuum energy (which in the
standard theory is infinite and negative) equals zero as it should be; iii) the
charge operator has correct properties only for massless particles with the
spins 0 and 1/2. In the AdS version of the theory there exists a dilemma that
either the notion of particles and antiparticles is absolute and then only
particles with a half-integer spin can be elementary or the notion is valid
only when energies are not asymptotically large and then supersymmetry is
possible.

Markov Transitions and the Propagation of Chaos,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0001076v1,['Alexander David Gottlieb'],"  The propagation of chaos is a central concept of kinetic theory that serves
to relate the equations of Boltzmann and Vlasov to the dynamics of
many-particle systems. Propagation of chaos means that molecular chaos, i.e.,
the stochastic independence of two random particles in a many-particle system,
persists in time, as the number of particles tends to infinity.
  We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a family of general
n-particle Markov processes to propagate chaos. This condition is expressed in
terms of the Markov transition functions associated to the n-particle
processes, and it amounts to saying that chaos of random initial states
propagates if it propagates for pure initial states.
  Our proof of this result relies on the weak convergence approach to the study
of chaos due to Sznitman and Tanaka. We assume that the space in which the
particles live is homeomorphic to a complete and separable metric space so that
we may invoke Prohorov's theorem in our proof.
  We also show that, if the particles can be in only finitely many states, then
molecular chaos implies that the specific entropies in the n-particle
distributions converge to the entropy of the limiting single-particle
distribution.

particle production in central Au+Au collisions, when expressed as $dN/d\eta'$

broad region of $\eta'$ around $\eta'=0$. This energy-independent region grows
with energy, allowing only a limited region (if any) of longitudinal

production in e+e- and Au+Au collisions (scaled by the number of participating
nucleon pairs). Both the total number of produced particles and the
longitudinal distribution of produced particles are approximately the same in
e+e- and in scaled Au+Au. This observation was not predicted and has not been

measured in the pseudorapidity region 2.9 < eta < 3.9 and 2.3 < eta < 3.7,

number of participating nucleons and the number of binary collisions. The
photon and charged particle production in the measured pseudorapidity range has
been shown to be consistent with energy independent limiting fragmentation
behavior. The photons are observed to follow a centrality independent limiting
fragmentation behavior while for the charged particles it is centrality
dependent. We have carried out a comparative study of the pseudorapidity
distributions of positively charged hadrons, negatively charged hadrons,
photons, pions, net protons in nucleus--nucleus collisions and pseudorapidity
distributions from p+p collisions. From these comparisons we conclude that
baryons in the inclusive charged particle distribution are responsible for the
observed centrality dependence of limiting fragmentation. The mesons are found
to follow an energy independent behavior of limiting fragmentation while the
behavior of baryons seems to be energy dependent.

Particle Localization by Decoherence and Classical Lensing,http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0702197v1,['Ivo Knittel'],"  A phenomenological model of the time evolution of a particle wavepacket is
presented that is subject to scattering event with small momentum transfer. It
is suited for three dimensions and allows for an additional potential. For a
random value of a phase parameter, it is equivalent to the decoherence by
scattering off plane wave field states. Imposing some condition on the same
phase parameter, the model delivers definite outcomes in a local pointer base.
Common sense notions about the quantum-classical transition are readily
obtained: Decoherent free particle solutions are localized constant-width
wavepackets, quantum barrier scattering results in random reflection and
transmission. The scattering process assumed in the phenomenological model is
realized by scattering of a particle pair interacting by a force-distance law
with small momentum transfer. Particles are localized not by decoherence but by
a classical lensing effect. Schmidt paths in the Schmidt representation of the
multiparticle state are products of single-particle wavepackets. Therefore the
model has a natural 'Many Worlds' interpretation, identifying each Schmidt path

Clustering in a stochastic model of one-dimensional gas,http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.0086v2,['Vladislav V. Vysotsky'],"  We give a quantitative analysis of clustering in a stochastic model of
one-dimensional gas. At time zero, the gas consists of $n$ identical particles
that are randomly distributed on the real line and have zero initial speeds.
Particles begin to move under the forces of mutual attraction. When particles
collide, they stick together forming a new particle, called cluster, whose mass
and speed are defined by the laws of conservation. We are interested in the
asymptotic behavior of $K_n(t)$ as $n\to \infty$, where $K_n(t)$ denotes the
number of clusters at time $t$ in the system with $n$ initial particles. Our
main result is a functional limit theorem for $K_n(t)$. Its proof is based on
the discovered localization property of the aggregation process, which states
that the behavior of each particle is essentially defined by the motion of
neighbor particles.

Three Particle Correlations from STAR,http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.0220v1,['Jason Glyndwr Ulery'],"  Two-particle correlations have shown modification to the away-side shape in
central Au+Au collisions relative to $pp$, d+Au and peripheral Au+Au
collisions. Different scenarios can explain this modification including: large
angle gluon radiation, jets deflected by transverse flow, path length dependent
energy loss, Cerenkov gluon radiation of fast moving particles, and conical
flow generated by hydrodynamic Mach-cone shock-waves. Three-particle
correlations have the power to distinguish the scenarios with conical emission,
conical flow and Cerenkov radiation, from other scenarios. In addition, the
dependence of the observed shapes on the $p_T$ of the associated particles can
be used to distinguish conical emission from a sonic boom (Mach-cone) and from
QCD-Cerenkov radiation. We present results from STAR on 3-particle azimuthal
correlations for a high $p_T$ trigger particle with two softer particles.
Results are shown for $pp$, d+Au and high statistics Au+Au collisions at

of combinatorial backgrounds. Systematic uncertainties due to this subtraction
and the flow harmonics v2 and v4 are investigated in detail. The implications

Clumping effects on non-thermal particle spectra in massive star systems,http://arxiv.org/abs/0710.3526v1,['A. Reimer'],"  Observational evidence exists that winds of massive stars are clumped. Many
massive star systems are known as non-thermal particle production sites, as
indicated by their synchrotron emission in the radio band. As a consequence
they are also considered as candidate sites for non-thermal high-energy photon
production up to gamma-ray energies. The present work considers the effects of
wind clumpiness expected on the emitting relativistic particle spectrum in
colliding wind systems, built up from the pool of thermal wind particles
through diffusive particle acceleration, and taking into account inverse
Compton and synchrotron losses. In comparison to a homogeneous wind, a clumpy
wind causes flux variations of the emitting particle spectrum when the clump
enters the wind collision region. It is found that the spectral features
associated with this variability moves temporally from low to high energy bands
with the time shift between any two spectral bands being dependent on clump
size, filling factor, and the energy-dependence of particle energy gains and

Assuming a power law structure for the vertical and the toroidal components of

the radial and the vertical velocities of the charged particles, in the

with radii smaller than a critical radius significantly are affected by the
magnetic force, motion of the particles with larger radii is independent of the
magnetic field. The critical radius depends on the magnetic geometry and the
charge of the grains. Assuming that a grain particle has one elementary charge
and the physical properties of the disc correspond to a minimum-mass solar
nebula, we show that only micron-sized grains are affected by the magnetic
force. Also, charge polarity determines direction of the radial velocity. For
such small particles, both the radial and the vertical velocities increase due

that the mean free path of the gas molecules equals the maximum size of the

time of the simulation, leaving a larger power law range. The number of
particles in the tail is ~1% of the downstream population, and they carry ~10%

of particles in the tail, we find that the energy gains occur as particles
bounce between the upstream and downstream regions in the magnetic fields

On A New Formulation of Micro-phenomena: The Double-slit Experiment,http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.1034v1,"['Afshin Shafiee', 'Abouzar Massoudi', 'Mohammad Bahrami']","  Based on the novel view that a micro-entity could be considered as a particle
associated with a field partaking of the energy of particle which are both
described by deterministic causal equations of motion, we examine the success
of our new theory in elucidating the underlying physics of the double-slit
experiment. Here, we explain with clear details how each micro-particle
scatters from one of the slits at a given time. After the scattering through
one of the slits, the particle shares some of its energy with its surrounding
field and a particle-field system is again formed which its motion is governed
by a deterministic dynamics during its flight towards the detecting screen. The
interference pattern is then explained by showing how the final location of
each particle-field system at the time of reaching the detecting screen is
distributed according to an angular distribution (equal to the what quantum
theory predicts for the fringe effects in a two-slit experiment). The
probabilistic nature of such a distribution can be explained by considering the
variations of the kinetic energy of the particle-field system at different
local situations.

solving the problem of massless particles in an electromagnetic field. We show
that the form of the Hamiltonian in the FW representation is independent of the

particles, this Hamiltonian contains quantum terms characterizing the
quadrupole coupling of moving particles to the electric field and the electric
and mixed polarizabilities. We obtain the quantum mechanical and semiclassical

continuous trajectories of particles from the source to the detector. This idea
seems to result as an unavoidable conclusion from some simple experiments. In
its original form, Hardy's thought-experiment was proposed for two independent
particles, a positron and an electron. The two either meet and annihilate, or
don't meet but become entangled. An important feature of entanglements with
particles that never meet is the difficulty they raise in front of the
assumption of ""hidden communication"" between the particles. Indeed, if the
particles don't meet, they can't have information of one another and it is
difficult to explain how can they communicate. In order to implement Hardy's
paradox with particles that never meet, the present article proposes to use
photons from three different lasers, one laser emitting UV rays, and the other
two emitting at the wavelength of the signal photon, respectively the idler
photon obtained from the down-conversion of the UV rays. The role of the
annihilation in Hardy's experiment will be played by the destructive
interference between a down-conversion pair and two photons from the low-energy

Generic theory of colloidal transport,http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.2924v1,"['Frank Julicher', 'Jacques Prost']","  We discuss the motion of colloidal particles relative to a two component

velocities on the particle surface due to surface dissipative phenomena. The
perturbations of the hydrodynamic flow field exhibits characteristic
differences in cases (i) and (ii) which reflect different patterns of momentum
flux corresponding to the existence of net forces, force dipoles or force
quadrupoles. In the absence of external fields, gradients of concentration or
pressure do not generate net forces on a colloidal particle. Such gradients can
nevertheless induce relative motion between particle and fluid. We present a
generic description of surface dissipative phenomena based on the linear
response of surface fluxes driven by conjugate surface forces. In this

via surface slip that is induced by active processes on the particle surface.

numerical simulations under quasistatic triaxial compression. The Contact
Dynamics method is used for this investigation with 40 000 particles. The
effect of particle shape is analyzed by comparing this packing with a packing

the origin of the higher shear strength of the polyhedra packing by considering
various anisotropy parameters characterizing the microstructure and force
transmission. Remarkably, we find that the polyhedra packing has a lower fabric
anisotropy in terms of branch vectors (joining the particle centers) than the
sphere packing. In contrast, the polyhedra packing shows a much higher force
anisotropy which is at the origin of its higher shear strength. The force
anisotropy in the polyhedra packing is shown to be related to the formation of
face-face contacts. In particular, most face-face contacts belong to strong
force chains along the major principal stress direction whereas vertex-face and
edge-edge contacts are correlated with weak forces and oriented on average
along the minor principal stress direction in steady shearing.

numerically the simultaneous dynamics of the particle and of the fluid. Such a
method gives a unique handle on the limit of validity of point-particle
approximations, which are generally used in applicative situations. Analytical
predictions based on such models are compared to result of very well resolved
direct numerical simulations. Evidence is obtained that Faxen corrections give
dominant finite-size corrections to velocity and acceleration fluctuations for
particle diameters up to four times the Kolmogorov scale. The dynamics of
particles with larger diameters is dominated by inertial-range physics, and is
consistent with predictions obtained from dimensional analysis.

low-particle-density range, the flux is enlarged by pheromone if the pheromone
evaporation rate is sufficiently low, ii) in the high particle-density range,
the flux is largest at a reasonably high evaporation rate and, iii) if the

these behaviors is investigated by observing the spatial-temporal evolution of

  functional study",http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.1386v1,['Yuri Martinez-Raton'],"  We present a scaled particle density functional study of two-dimensional
binary mixtures of hard convex particles with one or both species being
ellipses. In particular, we divide our study into two parts. The first part is
devoted to the calculation of phase diagrams of mixtures with the same
elliptical shapes, but with (i) different aspect ratios and equal particle
areas, (ii) equal aspect ratios and different particle areas and (iii) with the
former and the later being different. In the second study we obtain the phase
diagrams corresponding to crossed-mixtures of particles with species having
elliptical and rectangular shapes. We compare the phase diagram topologies and
explain their main features from the entropic nature of particle interactions
directly related to the anisotropies, areas, and shapes of species. The results
obtained can be corroborated by experiments on granular rods where the entropic
forces are very important in the stabilization of liquid-crystal textures at
the stationary states.

Errors in particle tracking velocimetry with high-speed cameras,http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.3540v1,"['Yan Feng', 'J. Goree', 'Bin Liu']","  Velocity errors in particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) are studied. When
using high-speed video cameras, the velocity error may increase at a high
camera frame rate. This increase in velocity error is due to particle-position
uncertainty, which is one of two sources of velocity errors studied here. The
other source of error is particle acceleration, which has the opposite trend of
diminishing at higher frame rates. Both kinds of errors can propagate into
quantities calculated from velocity, such as the kinetic temperature of
particles or correlation functions. As demonstrated in a dusty plasma
experiment, the kinetic temperature of particles has no unique value when
measured using PTV, but depends on the sampling time interval or frame rate. It
is also shown that an artifact appears in an autocorrelation function computed
from particle positions and velocities, and it becomes more severe when a small
sampling-time interval is used. Schemes to reduce these errors are
demonstrated.

Charging and coagulation of dust in protoplanetary plasma environments,http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.5677v1,"['L. S. Matthews', 'V. Land', 'T. W. Hyde']","  Combining a particle-particle, particle-cluster and cluster-cluster
agglomeration model with an aggregate charging model, the coagulation and
charging of dust particles in various plasma environments relevant for
proto-planetary disks have been investigated. The results show that charged
aggregates tend to grow by adding small particles and clusters to larger
particles and clusters, leading to greater sizes and masses as compared to
neutral aggregates, for the same number of monomers in the aggregate. In
addition, aggregates coagulating in a Lorentzian plasma (containing a larger
fraction of high-energy plasma particles) are more massive and larger than
aggregates coagulating in a Maxwellian plasma, for the same plasma densities
and characteristic temperature. Comparisons of the grain structure, utilizing
the compactness factor, {\phi}{\sigma}, demonstrate that a Lorentzian plasma
environment results in fluffier aggregates, with small {\phi}{\sigma}, which
exhibit a narrow compactness factor distribution. Neutral aggregates are more
compact, with larger {\phi}{\sigma}, and exhibit a larger variation in
fluffiness. Measurement of the compactness factor of large populations of
aggregates is shown to provide information on the disk parameters that were
present during aggregation.

between massive particles, the infinite energy in the centre of mass frame
occurs in some situations. Namely, for one particle the relationship between
the energy and angular momentum should have a special form (""critical""

The existence (or absence) of the effect is determined depending on competition
of two factors - gravitational blue shift for a photon propagating towards a
black hole and the Doppler effect due to transformation from the locally
nonrotating frame to a comoving one. Thus, a pure kinematic explanation is
suggested for the effect of infinitely growing energies in the centre of mass

Excluded volume interactions by the inert particles hinder the diffusive motion
of reactants. When the initial distribution of the inert particles is uniform,
the excluded volume interactions slow the decay of the survival probability of
a geminate pair in contrast to the acceleration of the decay found for the
target problem under the presence of the excluded volume interactions among
reactants. We also obtain the escape probability for a non-uniform initial
distribution of the inert particles and show that reaction yield is increased

Brownian motion of charged particles driven by correlated noise,http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.1891v1,"['V. Lisy', 'J. Tothova']","  Stochastic motion of charged particles in the magnetic field was first
studied almost half a century ago in the classical works by Taylor and

particles have been found. Later Furuse on the basis of standard Langevin
theory generalized their results for arbitrary times. The currently observed
revival of these problems is mainly related to memory effects in the diffusion
of particles, which appear when colored random forces act on the particles from
their surroundings. In the present work an exact analytical solution of the
generalized Langevin equation has been found for the motion of the particle in
an external magnetic field when the random force is exponentially correlated in
the time. The obtained MSD of the particle motion across the field contains a
term proportional to the time, a constant term, and contributions exponentially
decaying in the time. The results are more general than the previous results
from the literature and are obtained in a considerably simpler way applicable
to many other problems of the Brownian motion with memory.

Adiabatic nonlinear waves with trapped particles: I. General formalism,http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.3071v2,"['I. Y. Dodin', 'N. J. Fisch']","  A Lagrangian formalism is developed for a general nondissipative
quasiperiodic nonlinear wave with trapped particles in collisionless plasma.
The adiabatic time-averaged Lagrangian density $\mcc{L}$ is expressed in terms
of the single-particle oscillation-center Hamiltonians; once those are found,
the complete set of geometrical-optics equations is derived without referring
to the Maxwell-Vlasov system. The number of trapped particles is assumed fixed;
in particular, those may reside close to the bottom of the wave trapping
potential, so they never become untrapped. Then their contributions to the wave
momentum and the energy flux depend mainly on the trapped-particle density, as
an independent parameter, and the phase velocity rather than on the wave
amplitude $a$ explicitly; hence, $\mcc{L}$ acquires $a$-independent terms.
Also, the wave action is generally not conserved, because it can be exchanged
with resonant oscillations of the trapped-particle density. The corresponding
modification of the wave envelope equation is found explicitly, and the new
action flow velocity is derived. Applications of these results are left to the
other two papers of the series, where specific problems are addressed
pertaining to properties and dynamics of waves with trapped particles.

described within the Lagrangian model developed in Paper I, under the
assumption that the action distribution of these particles is conserved, and,
in particular, that their number within each wavelength is a fixed independent
parameter of the problem. One-dimensional nonlinear Langmuir waves with deeply
trapped electrons are addressed as a paradigmatic example. For a stationary
wave, tunneling into overcritical plasma is explained from the standpoint of
the action conservation theorem. For a nonstationary wave, qualitatively
different regimes are realized depending on the initial parameter $S$, which is
the ratio of the energy flux carried by trapped particles to that carried by
passing particles. At $S < 1/2$, a wave is stable and exhibits group velocity
splitting. At $S > 1/2$, the trapped-particle modulational instability (TPMI)
develops, in contrast with the existing theories of the TPMI yet in agreement
with the general sideband instability theory. Remarkably, these effects are not
captured by the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation, which is traditionally
considered as a universal model of wave self-action but misses the

coefficients which are determined by matching with the finite-difference

the singular-value decomposition. Here a more efficient method to achieve the

finite-difference solutions with spherical harmonic functions taken over a
spherical surface concentric with the particle. The new approach is tested on a

Collisional Penrose process near the horizon of extreme Kerr black holes,http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4350v2,"['Michał Bejger', 'Tsvi Piran', 'Marek Abramowicz', 'Frida Håkanson']","  Collisions of particles in black holes' ergospheres may result in an
arbitrarily large center of mass energy. This led recently to the suggestion
(Banados et al., 2009) that black holes can act as ultimate particle
accelerators. If the energy of an outgoing particle is larger than the total
energy of the infalling particles the energy excess must come from the
rotational energy of the black hole and hence this must involve a Penrose
process. However, while the center of mass energy diverges the position of the
collision makes it impossible for energetic particles to escape to infinity.
Following an earlier work on collisional Penrose processes (Piran & Shaham
1977) we show that even under the most favorable idealized conditions the
maximal energy of an escaping particle is only a modest factor above the total
initial energy of the colliding particles. This implies that one shouldn't
expect collisions around a black hole to act as spectacular cosmic
accelerators.

goal of today's astroparticle physics. Aims: To understand the acceleration

Therefore, the modification of a particle energy distribution, due to

by analytically solving the momentum-diffusion equation. For simplicity, the
turbulence was assumed to consist of one-dimensional Alfven waves. Results:
Using both methods, it is shown that, on average, all particles with velocities

Conclusions: Because of electromagnetic turbulence, a particle energy spectrum
measured at Earth can drastically deviate from its initial spectrum. However,
for particles with velocities significantly above the Alfven speed, the effect
becomes negligible.

Ameba-inspired Self-organizing Particle Systems,http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.4259v1,"['Shlomi Dolev', 'Robert Gmyr', 'Andrea W. Richa', 'Christian Scheideler']","  Particle systems are physical systems of simple computational particles that

Self-organizing particle systems have many interesting applications like
coating objects for monitoring and repair purposes and the formation of

Active Matter Ratchets with an External Drift,http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.3741v1,"['C. Reichhardt', 'C. J. Olson Reichhardt']","  When active matter particles such as swimming bacteria are placed in an
asymmetric array of funnels, it has been shown that a ratchet effect can occur

two dimensional arrays of funnels or L-shapes where there is also an externally
applied dc drive or drift. We show that for certain conditions, the ratchet
effect can be strongly enhanced, and that it is possible to have conditions
under which run-and-tumble particles with one run length move in the opposite
direction from particles with a different run length. For the arrays of
L-shapes, we find that the application of a drift force can enhance a
transverse rectification in the direction perpendicular to the drift. When
particle-particle steric interactions are included, we find that the ratchet
effects can be either enhanced or suppressed depending on barrier geometry,
particle run length, and particle density.

also uses a twisted proposal as in Whiteley, et al (2013) to obtain a
low-variance estimate of the HMM normalising constant. We demonstrate via
numerical examples that, in some scenarios, this estimate has a much lower
variance than that of the estimate obtained via the alive particle filter. The
low variance of this normalising constant estimate encourages the
implementation of our SMC algorithm within a particle marginal
Metropolis-Hastings (PMMH) scheme, and we call the resulting methodology
``alive twisted PMMH''. We numerically demonstrate on a stochastic volatility
model how our alive twisted PMMH can converge faster than the standard alive
PMMH of Jasra, et al (2013).

"Modeling fine particle (dusty) plasmas and charge-stabilized colloidal
  suspensions as inhomogeneous Yukawa systems",http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.7673v2,['Hiroo Totsuji'],"  In order to give a basis for the structure and correlation analysis of fine
particle (dusty) plasma and colloidal suspensions, thermodynamic treatment of
mixtures of macroscopic and microscopic charged particles within the adiabatic
response of the latter is extended to include the case where the system is
finite and weakly inhomogeneous. It is shown that the effective potential for
macroscopic particles is composed of two elements: mutual Yukawa repulsion and
a confining (attractive) Yukawa potential from their `shadow' (the average
charge density of macroscopic particles multiplied by the minus sign). The
result clarifies the relation between two approaches hitherto taken where
either a parabolic one-body potential is assumed or the average distribution is
assumed to be flat with finite extension. Since the satisfaction of the charge
neutrality is largely enhanced by the existence of macroscopic particles, the
assumption of the flat electrostatic potential and therefore flat average
distribution of macroscopic particles in the domain of their existence is
expected to be closer to reality than the assumption of the parabolic potential
in that domain.

Collective Dynamics of Interacting Particles in Unsteady Flows,http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0558v1,"['Maryam Abedi', 'Mir Abbas Jalali']","  We use the Fokker-Planck equation and its moment equations to study the
collective behavior of interacting particles in unsteady one-dimensional flows.
Particles interact according to a long-range attractive and a short-range
repulsive potential field known as Morse potential. We assume Stokesian drag
force between particles and their carrier fluid, and find analytic
single-peaked traveling solutions for the spatial density of particles in the
catastrophic phase. In steady flow conditions the streaming velocity of
particles is identical to their carrier fluid, but we show that particle
streaming is asynchronous with an unsteady carrier fluid. Using linear
perturbation analysis, the stability of traveling solutions is investigated in
unsteady conditions. It is shown that the resulting dispersion relation is an
integral equation of the Fredholm type, and yields two general families of
stable modes: singular modes whose eigenvalues form a continuous spectrum, and
a finite number of discrete global modes. Depending on the value of drag
coefficient, stable modes can be over-damped, critically damped, or decaying
oscillatory waves. The results of linear perturbation analysis are confirmed
through the numerical solution of the fully nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation.

there is a critical Mason number (ratio of viscous to magnetic forces) below

reconnection, which in turn leads to high magnetic field saturation and
enhancement of Maxwell stress tensor of angular momentum transport. Meanwhile,
during the quiescent stage of reconnection the plasma isotropization progresses
in the channel flow, and the anisotropic plasma with $p_{\perp} > p_{\|}$ due
to the dynamo action of MRI outside the channel flow contributes to rapid

transverse oscillations in their motion. As channeled particles approach the
atomic planes of a crystal, they are likely to be dechanneled. This effect was
used in ion-beam analysis with MeV energy. We studied this effect in a bent
crystal for positive and negative particles within a wide range of energies in
sight of application of such crystals at accelerators. We found the conditions
for the appearance or not of channeling oscillations. Indeed a new kind of
oscillations, strictly related to the motion of over-barrier particles, i.e.
quasichanneling particles, has been predicted. Such oscillations, named planar
quasichanneling oscillations, possess a different nature than channeling
oscillations. Through computer simulation, we studied this effect and provided
a theoretical interpretation for them. We show that channeling oscillations can
be observed only for positive particles while quasichanneling oscillations can
exist for particles with either sign. The conditions for experimental
observation of channeling and quasichanneling oscillations at existing

How to observe duality in entanglement of two distinguishable particles?,http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01525v1,"['Marcin Karczewski', 'Pawel Kurzynski']","  The entanglement between two bosons or fermions can be accessed if there
exists an auxiliary degree of freedom which can be used to label and
effectively distinguish the two particles. For some types of entanglement
between two indistinguishable particles one can observe duality, i.e., if the
entanglement is present in the Hilbert space H and an auxiliary Hilbert space
H' is used to label the particles, then if we used H as a label the
entanglement would be present in H'. For distinguishable particles this effect
does not occur because of superselection rules which prevent superpositions of
different types of particles. However, it is known that superselection rules
can be bypassed if one uses special auxiliary states that are known as
reference frames. Here we study properties of reference frames which allow for
an observation of a duality in entanglement between two distinguishable
particles. Finally, we discuss the consequences of this result from the
resource-theoretic point of view.

particle hits the boundary point $0$, it is removed from the system along with
a second particle chosen uniformly from the particles in $(0,\infty)$. Under
the assumption that the initial empirical measure of the particle system
converges weakly to a measure with density $f_0(x) \in L^1_+(0,\infty)$, the
empirical measure of the particle system at time $t$ is shown to converge to
the measure with density $f(x,t)$, where $f$ is the unique solution to the

experiments on bidisperse (1 and 1.2 $\mu$m in size) colloidal samples with

reversible trajectory, it has a nonzero probability of becoming irreversible in
the following shearing cycle. This probability was previously found to be
approximately zero for an analogous athermal system. We demonstrate that the
stability of reversibility depends both on packing fraction, $\phi$ , and the
shearing amplitude, $\gamma_0$. In addition, we identify hysteresis in the
dynamics of rearrangements for reversible particles, which indicates that such
rearrangements are dissipative. At lower packing fractions, this hysteresis
becomes less prominent, and the dynamics is moved closer to equilibrium by

excited states in the vicinity of the normal-superfluid phase transition, which
might explain the difficult in detecting collective pairing phenomena as for

Particle Efficient Importance Sampling,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.6745v1,"['Marcel Scharth', 'Robert Kohn']","  The efficient importance sampling (EIS) method is a general principle for the
numerical evaluation of high-dimensional integrals that uses the sequential
structure of target integrands to build variance minimising importance
samplers. Despite a number of successful applications in high dimensions, it is
well known that importance sampling strategies are subject to an exponential
growth in variance as the dimension of the integration increases. We solve this
problem by recognising that the EIS framework has an offline sequential Monte
Carlo interpretation. The particle EIS method is based on non-standard
resampling weights that take into account the look-ahead construction of the
importance sampler. We apply the method for a range of univariate and bivariate
stochastic volatility specifications. We also develop a new application of the
EIS approach to state space models with Student's t state innovations. Our
results show that the particle EIS method strongly outperforms both the
standard EIS method and particle filters for likelihood evaluation in high
dimensions. Moreover, the ratio between the variances of the particle EIS and
particle filter methods remains stable as the time series dimension increases.
We illustrate the efficiency of the method for Bayesian inference using the

the universe evolves from a matter-dominated phase of contraction to an

couples only to gravity and particle creation via interactions between the

produce particles in this model, we find that Parker particle production is
sufficient to reheat the universe to high temperatures. Thus there is {\it{a

rate $\Gamma$ scales with the total adsorbed mass $\Gamma\propto Km$. In
contrast, in the regime where particles diffuse freely over the resonator, the
dissipation rate scales as the product of the total adsorbed mass and the
individual particle mass: $\Gamma\propto Km^2$.

"Lagrangian velocity and acceleration correlations of large inertial
  particles in a closed turbulent flow",http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07754v1,"['Nathanaël Machicoane', 'Romain Volk']","  We investigate the response of large inertial particle to turbulent
fluctuations in a inhomogeneous and anisotropic flow. We conduct a Lagrangian
study using particles both heavier and lighter than the surrounding fluid, and
whose diameters are comparable to the flow integral scale. Both velocity and
acceleration correlation functions are analyzed to compute the Lagrangian
integral time and the acceleration time scale of such particles. The knowledge
of how size and density affect these time scales is crucial in understanding
partical dynamics and may permit stochastic process modelization using two-time
models (for instance Saw-ford's). As particles are tracked over long times in
the quasi totality of a closed flow, the mean flow influences their behaviour
and also biases the velocity time statistics, in particular the velocity
correlation functions. By using a method that allows for the computation of
turbulent velocity trajectories, we can obtain unbiased Lagrangian integral
time. This is particularly useful in accessing the scale separation for such
particles and to comparing it to the case of fluid particles in a similar
configuration.

"Decoherence in the classical limit of histories of a particle coupled to
  a von Neumann apparatus",http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04234v1,['Francesc S. Roig'],"  Using the Gell-Mann and Hartle formalism of generalized quantum mechanics of
closed systems, we study the classical limit of coarse-grained spacetime
histories and their decoherence. The system under consideration is
one-dimensional and consists of a particle coupled to a von Neumann apparatus
that performs a measurement of the position of the particle during the finite
time interval during which the histories of this system take place. We consider
two cases: a free particle and a harmonic oscillator. The real line is divided
into intervals of the same length, and coarse-grained histories are defined by
the time average of the position of the particle on a given Feynman path to be
within one of these intervals. The position of the pointer in each Feynman path
correlates with this time average. The class operators for this system have
been evaluated, and the decoherence functional shows that these coarse-grained
histories do not decohere, not even when initially either the particle or the
pointer is in an eigenstate of position. Decoherence is obtained only when the
classical limit is taken. Qualitative arguments for decoherence in the
classical limit are presented for the case of a general particle potential.

Ensemble equivalence for distinguishable particles,http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.07794v1,"['A. Fernandez-Peralta', 'Raul Toral']","  Statistics of distinguishable particles has become relevant in systems of
colloidal particles and in the context of applications of statistical mechanics
to complex networks. When studying these type of systems with the standard
textbook formalism, non-physical results such as non-extensive entropies are
obtained. In this paper, we will show that the commonly used expression for the
partition function of a system of distinguishable particles leads to huge
fluctuations of the number of particles in the grand canonical ensemble and,
consequently, to non-equivalence of statistical ensembles. We will see how a
new proposed definition for the entropy of distinguishable particles by
Swendsen [J. Stat. Phys. 107, 1143 (2002)] solves the problem and restores
ensemble equivalence. We also show that the new proposal for the partition
function does not produce any inconsistency for a system of distinguishable
localized particles, where the monoparticular partition function is not
extensive.

recorded by the ATLAS detector during a special Large Hadron Collider fill. The
charged-particle multiplicity, its dependence on transverse momentum and
pseudorapidity and the dependence of the mean transverse momentum on the
charged-particle multiplicity are presented. The measurements are performed
with charged particles with transverse momentum greater than 500 MeV and
absolute pseudorapidity less than 2.5, in events with at least one charged
particle satisfying these kinematic requirements. Additional measurements in a
reduced phase space with absolute pseudorapidity less than 0.8 are also
presented, in order to compare with other experiments. The results are
corrected for detector effects, presented as particle-level distributions and
are compared to the predictions of various Monte Carlo event generators.

"Microstructure evolution of compressible granular systems under large
  deformations",http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02193v1,"['Marcial Gonzalez', 'Alberto M. Cuitino']","  We report three-dimensional particle mechanics static calculations that
predict the microstructure evolution during die-compaction of elastic spherical
particles up to relative densities close to one. We employ a nonlocal contact
formulation that remains predictive at high levels of confinement by removing
the classical assumption that contacts between particles are formulated locally
as independent pair-interactions. The approach demonstrates that the
coordination number depends on the level of compressibility, i.e., on the
Poisson's ratio, of the particles. Results also reveal that distributions of
contact forces between particles and between particles and walls, although
similar at jamming onset, are very different at full compaction. Particle-wall
forces are in remarkable agreement with experimental measurements reported in
the literature, providing a unifying framework for bridging experimental
boundary observations with bulk behavior.

Dynamics of inert spheres in active suspensions of micro-rotors,http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03946v1,"['Kyongmin Yeo', 'Enkeleida Lushi', 'Petia M. Vlahovska']","  Inert particles suspended in active fluids of self-propelled particles are
known to often exhibit enhanced diffusion and novel coherent structures. Here
we numerically investigate the dynamical behavior and self-organization in a
system consisting of passive and actively rotating spheres. The particles
interact through direct collisions and the fluid flows generated as they move.
In the absence of passive particles, three states emerge in a binary mixture of
spinning spheres depending on particle fraction: a dilute gas-like state where
the rotors move chaotically, a phase-separated state where like-rotors move in
lanes or vortices, and a jammed state where crystals continuously assemble,
melt and move (K. Yeo, E. Lushi, and P. M. Vlahovska, Phys. Rev. Lett. 114,
188301 (2015)). Passive particles added to the rotor suspension modify the
system dynamics and pattern formation: while states identified in the pure
active suspension still emerge, they occur at different densities and mixture
proportions. The dynamical behavior of the inert particles is also
non-trivially dependent on the system composition.

Is the motion of a single SPH particle droplet/solid physically correct?,http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07902v1,"['Kamil Szewc', 'Katarzyna Walczewska-Szewc', 'Michał Olejnik']","  In recent years the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) approach gained
popularity in modeling multiphase and free-surface flows. In many situations,
due to certain reasons, interface and free-surface fragmentation occurs. As a
result single SPH particle solids/droplets of one phase can appear and travel
through other phases. In this paper we investigate this issue focusing on a
movement of such single SPH particles. The main questions we try to answer here
are: is movement of such particles physically correct? What is its physical
size? How numerical parameters affect on it? With this in mind we performed
simple simulations of solid particles falling due to gravity in a fluid.
Considering three different diameters of a single particle, we compared values
of the drag coefficient and the velocity obtained through the SPH approach with
the experimental and the analytical reference data. In the way to accurately
model multiphase flows with free-surfaces we proposed and validated a novel SPH
formulation.

  particles",http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02197v2,"['S. Belan', 'A. Chernykh', 'V. Lebedev', 'G. Falkovich']","  The inelastic collapse of stochastic trajectories of a randomly accelerated
particle moving in half-space $z > 0$ has been discovered by McKean and then
independently re-discovered by Cornell et. al. The essence of this phenomenon
is that particle arrives to a wall at $z = 0$ with zero velocity after an
infinite number of inelastic collisions if the restitution coefficient $\beta$
of particle velocity is smaller than the critical value
$\beta_c=\exp(-\pi/\sqrt{3})$. We demonstrate that inelastic collapse takes
place also in a wide class of models with spatially inhomogeneous random force
and, what is more, that the critical value $\beta_c$ is universal. That class
includes an important case of inertial particles in wall-bounded random flows.
To establish how the inelastic collapse influence the particle distribution, we
construct an exact equilibrium probability density function $\rho(z,v)$ for
particle position and velocity. The equilibrium distribution exists only at
$\beta<\beta_c$ and indicates that inelastic collapse does not necessarily mean
the near-wall localization.

  Distribution Functions of Boomerang Colloidal Particles",http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04340v1,"['Ayan Chakrabarty', 'Feng Wang', 'Kai Sun', 'Qi-Huo Wei']","  Prior studies have shown that low symmetry particles such as micro-boomerangs
exhibit behaviour of Brownian motion rather different from that of high
symmetry particles because convenient tracking points (TPs) are usually
inconsistent with the center of hydrodynamic stress (CoH) where the
translational and rotational motions are decoupled. In this paper we study the
effects of the translation-rotation coupling on the displacement probability
distribution functions (PDFs) of the boomerang colloid particles with symmetric
arms. By tracking the motions of different points on the particle symmetry
axis, we show that as the distance between the TP and the CoH is increased, the
effects of translation-rotation coupling becomes pronounced, making the
short-time 2D PDF for fixed initial orientation to change from elliptical to
crescent shape and the angle averaged PDFs from ellipsoidal-particle-like PDF
to a shape with a Gaussian top and long displacement tails. We also observed
that at long times the PDFs revert to Gaussian. This crescent shape of 2D PDF
provides a clear physical picture of the non-zero mean displacements observed
in boomerangs particles.
