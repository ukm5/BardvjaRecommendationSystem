Is Physics Sick? [In Praise of Classical Physics],http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0592v1,['Hisham Ghassib'],"  In this paper, it is argued that theoretical physics is more akin to an
organism than to a rigid structure.It is in this sense that the epithet,
""sick"", applies to it. It is argued that classical physics is a model of a
healthy science, and the degree of sickness of modern physics is measured
accordingly. The malady is located in the relationship between mathematics and
physical meaning in physical theory.

Fundamental Dilemmas in Theoretical Physics,http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5530v1,['Hisham Ghassib'],"  In this paper, we argue that there are foundational dilemmas in theoretical
physics related to the concept of reality and the nature of mathematics in
physics. Physical theory is treated as a conceptual organism which develops
under the weight of its internal contradictions. The paper discusses in depth
the problem of objective reality in physics and its relation to scientific
practice. Then, it explores the problematic relation between physical meaning
and mathematics in modern physical theory, followed by a discussion of the
trend of contemporary physics to replace physical principles with pure
mathematical principles. Finally, it discusses the problem of logical coherence
in modern physical theory. The paper emphasizes the importance of resolving
these dilemmas to the proper practice of theoretical physics.
