Is Physics Sick? [In Praise of Classical Physics],http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0592v1,['Hisham Ghassib'],"  In this paper, it is argued that theoretical physics is more akin to an
organism than to a rigid structure.It is in this sense that the epithet,
""sick"", applies to it. It is argued that classical physics is a model of a
healthy science, and the degree of sickness of modern physics is measured
accordingly. The malady is located in the relationship between mathematics and
physical meaning in physical theory.

Fundamental Dilemmas in Theoretical Physics,http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5530v1,['Hisham Ghassib'],"  In this paper, we argue that there are foundational dilemmas in theoretical
physics related to the concept of reality and the nature of mathematics in
physics. Physical theory is treated as a conceptual organism which develops
under the weight of its internal contradictions. The paper discusses in depth
the problem of objective reality in physics and its relation to scientific
practice. Then, it explores the problematic relation between physical meaning
and mathematics in modern physical theory, followed by a discussion of the
trend of contemporary physics to replace physical principles with pure
mathematical principles. Finally, it discusses the problem of logical coherence
in modern physical theory. The paper emphasizes the importance of resolving
these dilemmas to the proper practice of theoretical physics.

2T-Physics 2001,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0106021v3,['Itzhak Bars'],"  The physics that is traditionally formulated in one--time-physics
(1T-physics) can also be formulated in two-time-physics (2T-physics). The
physical phenomena in 1T or 2T physics are not different, but the spacetime
formalism used to describe them is. The 2T description involves two extra
dimensions (one time and one space), is more symmetric, and makes manifest many
hidden features of 1T-physics. One such hidden feature is that families of
apparently different 1T-dynamical systems in d dimensions holographically
describe the same 2T system in d+2 dimensions. In 2T-physics there are two
timelike dimensions, but there is also a crucial gauge symmetry that thins out
spacetime, thus making 2T-physics effectively equivalent to 1T-physics. The
gauge symmetry is also responsible for ensuring causality and unitarity in a
spacetime with two timelike dimensions. What is gained through 2T-physics is a
unification of diverse 1T dynamics by making manifest hidden symmetries and
relationships among them. Such symmetries and relationships is the evidence for
the presence of the underlying higher dimensional spacetime structure.
2T-physics could be viewed as a device for gaining a better understanding of
1T-physics, but beyond this, 2T-physics offers new vistas in the search of the
unified theory while raising deep questions about the meaning of spacetime. In
these lectures, the recent developments in the powerful gauge field theory
formulation of 2T-physics will be described after a brief review of the results
obtained so far in the more intuitive worldline approach.

  gender differences but do not predict future course performance for physics
  majors",http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11262v1,"['Kyle M. Whitcomb', 'Chandralekha Singh']","  Analysis of institutional data for physics majors showing predictive
relationships between required mathematics and physics courses in various years
is important for contemplating how the courses build on each other and whether
there is need to make changes to the curriculum for the majors to strengthen
these relationships. We use 15 years of institutional data at a large research
university to investigate how introductory physics and mathematics courses
predict male and female physics majors' performance on required advanced
physics and mathematics courses. We used Structure Equation Modeling (SEM) to
investigate these predictive relationships and find that among introductory and
advanced physics and mathematics courses, there are gender differences in
performance in favor of male students only in the introductory physics courses
after controlling for high school GPA. We found that a measurement invariance
fully holds in a multi-group SEM by gender, so it was possible to carry out
analysis with gender mediated by introductory physics and high school GPA.
Moreover, we find that these introductory physics courses that have gender
differences do not predict performance in advanced physics courses. Also,
introductory mathematics courses predict performance in advanced mathematics
courses which in turn predict performance in advanced physics courses.
Furthermore, apart from the introductory physics courses that do not predict
performance in future physics courses, there is a strong predictive
relationship between the sophomore, junior and senior level physics courses.

transformations. Thus the squeeze transformation is one of the fundamental
transformations in Einstein's Lorentz-covariant world. It is possible to define
a complete set of orthonormal functions defined for one Lorentz frame. It is
shown that the same set can be used for other Lorentz frames. Transformation
properties are discussed. Physical applications are discussed in both optics
and high-energy physics. It is shown that the Lorentz harmonics provide the
mathematical basis for squeezed states of light. It is shown also that the same
set of harmonics can be used for understanding Lorentz-boosted hadrons in
high-energy physics. It is thus possible to transmit physics from one branch of
physics to the other branch using the mathematical basis common to them.

Structure and Evolution of Indian Physics Co-authorship Networks,http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05400v1,"['Chakresh Kumar Singh', 'Shivakumar Jolad']","  We trace the evolution of Indian physics community from 1919 to 2013 by
analysing the coauthorship network constructed from papers published by authors
in India in American Physical Society journals. We make inferences on Indias
contribution to different branches of Physics and identify the most influential
Indian physicists at different time periods. The relative contribution of India
to global physics publication(research) and its variation across subfields of
Physics is assessed. We extract the changing collaboration pattern of authors
between Indian physicists through various network measures. We study the
evolution of Indian physics communities and trace the mean life and
stationarity of communities by size in different APS journals. We map the
transition of authors between communities of different sizes from 1970 to 2013,
capturing their birth, growth, merger and collapse. We find that Indian-Foreign
collaborations are increasing at a faster pace compared to the Indian-Indian.
We observe that the degree distribution of Indian collaboration networks
follows the power law, with distinct patterns between Physical Review A, B and
E, and high energy physics journals Physical Review C and D, and Physical
Review Letters. In almost every measure, we observe strong structural
differences between low-energy and high-energy physics journals.

On the Conservation of Physical Quantities,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/9911013v1,['D. M. Snyder'],"  Certain transformations of isolated physical systems underlying various
conservation laws in physics are noted. As regards each of these
transformations, there is a theoretical action that is equivalent to a matched
physical action on the system. Evidence supporting this thesis is found in
experimental psychological research where results of various experiments allow
that the imagined rotation of an object is analogous to a physical rotation.
The conservation laws based on the transformations noted are theoretical or
mental in nature to the same extent that they are physical. When one of the
conservation principles noted is tested by carrying out the relevant
transformation on the system, this test is essentially one of the influence of
mental activity on physical reality.

Problem Solving and the Use of Math in Physics Courses,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0608268v1,['Edward F. Redish'],"  Mathematics is an essential element of physics problem solving, but experts
often fail to appreciate exactly how they use it. Math may be the language of
science, but math-in-physics is a distinct dialect of that language. Physicists
tend to blend conceptual physics with mathematical symbolism in a way that
profoundly affects the way equations are used and interpreted. Research with
university physics students in classes from algebra-based introductory physics
indicates that the gap between what students think they are supposed to be

"Lessons from failures to achieve what was possible in the twentieth
  century physics",http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.4218v1,['Vesselin Petkov'],"  For several decades there has been no breakthrough in fundamental physics as
revolutionary as relativity and quantum physics despite the amazing advancement
of applied physics and technology. By discussing several examples of what
physics could have achieved by now, but failed, I will argue that the present
state of fundamental physics is not caused by the lack of talented physicists,
but rather by problematic general views on how one should do physics. Although
it appears to be widely believed that such general views cannot affect the
advancement of physics I would like to draw the attention of the younger
generation of physicists to three reasons that might have been responsible for
failures in the past and might cause problems in the future: (i) misconceptions
on the nature of physical theories, (ii) underestimation of the role of
conceptual analyses so successfully employed by Galileo and Einstein, and (iii)
overestimation of the predictive power of mathematics in physics.

Analysing the Competency of Mathematical Modelling in Physics,http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02966v1,['Edward F. Redish'],"  A primary goal of physics is to create mathematical models that allow both
predictions and explanations of physical phenomena. We weave maths extensively
into our physics instruction beginning in high school, and the level and
complexity of the maths we draw on grows as our students progress through a
physics curriculum. Despite much research on the learning of both physics and
math, the problem of how to successfully teach most of our students to use
maths in physics effectively remains unsolved. A fundamental issue is that in
physics, we don't just use maths, we think about the physical world with it. As
a result, we make meaning with math-ematical symbology in a different way than
mathematicians do. In this talk we analyze how developing the competency of
mathematical modeling is more than just ""learning to do math"" but requires
learning to blend physical meaning into mathematical representations and use
that physical meaning in solving problems. Examples are drawn from across the
curriculum.

"The golden age of Calcutta physics: Difficulties in reconstructing the
  history",http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02551v1,['Arnab Rai Choudhuri'],"  Classes started in the newly established Physics Department of Calcutta
University Science College in 1916. Raman, Bose and Saha were three young
members of the small physics faculty consisting of barely half a dozen faculty
members. Within about one decade, three extraordinary discoveries came from
these young men---Saha ionization equation in 1920, Bose statistics in 1924,
Raman effect in 1928. However, fortunes of Calcutta University quickly got
intertwined with India's freedom struggle led by Mahatma Gandhi exactly at the
same time and the physics group got tragically disrupted. Indian physics never
succeeded in reaching that height again. This paper discusses the difficulties
in reconstructing a critical history of this Calcutta school of physics during
the very short epoch of unmatched brilliance.

  dimensions",http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04828v1,"['Avik Dutt', 'Qian Lin', 'Luqi Yuan', 'Momchil Minkov', 'Meng Xiao', 'Shanhui Fan']","  The concept of synthetic dimensions, which has enabled the study of
higher-dimensional physics on lower-dimensional physical structures, has
generated significant recent interest in many branches of science ranging from
ultracold-atomic physics to photonics, since such a concept provides a
versatile platform for realizing effective gauge potentials and novel
topological physics. Previous experiments demonstrating this concept have
augmented the real-space dimensionality by one additional physical synthetic
dimension. Here we endow a single ring resonator with two independent physical
synthetic dimensions. Our system consists of a temporally modulated ring
resonator with spatial coupling between the clockwise and counterclockwise
modes, creating a synthetic Hall ladder along the frequency and pseudospin
degrees of freedom for photons propagating in the ring. We experimentally
observe a wide variety of rich physics, including effective spin-orbit
coupling, magnetic fields, spin-momentum locking, a Meissner-to-vortex phase
transition, and chiral currents, completely in synthetic dimensions. Our
experiments demonstrate that higher-dimensional physics can be studied in
simple systems by leveraging the concept of multiple simultaneous synthetic
dimensions.

"Speculative Physics: the Ontology of Theory and Experiment in High
  Energy Particle Physics and Science Fiction",http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5636v1,['Clarissa Ai Ling Lee'],"  The dissertation brings together approaches across the fields of physics,
critical theory, literary studies, philosophy of physics, sociology of science,
and history of science to synthesize a hybrid approach for instigating more
rigorous and intense cross-disciplinary interrogations between the sciences and
the humanities. There are two levels of conversations going on in the
dissertation; at the first level, the discussion is centered on a critical
historiography and philosophical implications of the discovery Higgs boson in
relation to its position at the intersection of old (current) and the potential
for new possibilities in quantum physics; I then position my findings on the
Higgs boson in connection to the double-slit experiment that represents
foundational inquiries into quantum physics, to demonstrate the bridge between
fundamental physics and high energy particle physics. The conceptualization of
the variants of the double-slit experiment informs the aforementioned critical
comparisons. At the second level of the conversation, theories are produced
from a close study of the physics objects as speculative engine for new
knowledge generation that are then reconceptualized and re-articulated for
extrapolation into the speculative ontology of hard science fiction,
particularly the hard science fiction written with the double intent of
speaking to the science while producing imaginative and socially conscious
science through the literary affordances of science fiction. The works of
science fiction examined here demonstrate the tension between the internal
values of physics in the practice of theory and experiment and questions on
ethics, culture, and morality.

Inner privacy of conscious experiences and quantum information,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00909v1,['Danko D. Georgiev'],"  The human mind is constituted by inner, subjective, private, first-person
conscious experiences that cannot be measured with physical devices or observed
from an external, objective, public, third-person perspective. The qualitative,
phenomenal nature of conscious experiences also cannot be communicated to
others in the form of a message composed of classical bits of information.
Because in a classical world everything physical is observable and
communicable, it is a daunting task to explain how an empirically unobservable,
incommunicable consciousness could have any physical substrates such as neurons
composed of biochemical molecules, water, and electrolytes. The challenges
encountered by classical physics are exemplified by a number of thought
experiments including the inverted qualia argument, the private language
argument, the beetle in the box argument and the knowledge argument. These
thought experiments, however, do not imply that our consciousness is
nonphysical and our introspective conscious testimonies are untrustworthy. The
principles of classical physics have been superseded by modern quantum physics,
which contains two fundamentally different kinds of physical objects:
unobservable quantum state vectors, which define what physically exists, and
quantum operators (observables), which define what can physically be observed.
Identifying consciousness with the unobservable quantum information contained
by quantum physical brain states allows for application of quantum information
theorems to resolve possible paradoxes created by the inner privacy of
conscious experiences, and explains how the observable brain is constructed by
accessible bits of classical information that are bound by Holevo's theorem and
extracted from the physically existing quantum brain upon measurement with
physical devices.

computation are established. First it is proven that there cannot be a physical
computer C to which one can pose any and all computational tasks concerning the
physical universe. Next it is proven that no physical computer C can correctly
carry out any computational task in the subset of such tasks that can be posed
to C. As a particular example, this means that there cannot be a physical
computer that can, for any physical system external to that computer, take the
specification of that external system's state as input and then correctly
predict its future state before that future state actually occurs. The results
also mean that there cannot exist an infallible, general-purpose observation
apparatus, and that there cannot be an infallible, general-purpose control
apparatus. These results do not rely on systems that are infinite, and/or
non-classical, and/or obey chaotic dynamics. They also hold even if one uses an

Heuristic rule for constructing physics axiomatization,http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.4586v1,['Florin Moldoveanu'],"  Constructing the Theory of Everything (TOE) is an elusive goal of today's

axiomatization, a necessary part of the TOE. The purpose of this contribution
is to show how physics axiomatization can be achieved guided by a new heuristic

everything. Three physical principles will be identified from the heuristic
rule and they in turn will generate uniqueness results of various technical
strengths regarding space, time, non-relativistic and relativistic quantum
mechanics, electroweak symmetry and the dimensionality of space-time. The hope
is that the strong force and the Standard Model axiomatizations are not too far
out. Quantum gravity and cosmology are harder problems and maybe new approaches
are needed. However, complete physics axiomatization seems to be an achievable

Information-Based Physics: An Observer-Centric Foundation,http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.1667v1,['Kevin H. Knuth'],"  It is generally believed that physical laws, reflecting an inherent order in
the universe, are ordained by nature. However, in modern physics the observer
plays a central role raising questions about how an observer-centric physics
can result in laws apparently worthy of a universal nature-centric physics.
Over the last decade, we have found that the consistent apt quantification of
algebraic and order-theoretic structures results in calculi that possess
constraint equations taking the form of what are often considered to be
physical laws. I review recent derivations of the formal relations among
relevant variables central to special relativity, probability theory and
quantum mechanics in this context by considering a problem where two observers
form consistent descriptions of and make optimal inferences about a free
particle that simply influences them. I show that this approach to describing
such a particle based only on available information leads to the mathematics of
relativistic quantum mechanics as well as a description of a free particle that
reproduces many of the basic properties of a fermion. The result is an approach
to foundational physics where laws derive from both consistent descriptions and
optimal information-based inferences made by embedded observers.

How device-independent approaches change the meaning of physical theory,http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01035v3,['Alexei Grinbaum'],"  Dirac sought an interpretation of mathematical formalism in terms of physical
entities and Einstein insisted that physics should describe ""the real states of
the real systems"". While Bell inequalities put into question the reality of
states, modern device-independent approaches do away with the idea of entities:
physical theory may contain no physical systems. Focusing on the correlations
between operationally defined inputs and outputs, device-independent methods
promote a view more distant from the conventional one than Einstein's
'principle theories' were from 'constructive theories'. On the examples of
indefinite causal orders and almost quantum correlations, we ask a puzzling
question: if physical theory is not about systems, then what is it about? The
answer given by the device-independent models is that physics is about
languages. In moving away from the information-theoretic reconstructions of
quantum theory, this answer marks a new conceptual development in the
foundations of physics.

be invoked through cyber security attacks against the camera's software
vulnerabilities to administratively change the camera's physical configuration
settings. When such Cyber Physical attacks occur, they affect the integrity of

standard model. This talk is about tau lepton physics, but I begin with the
question: do we know how to find new physics in the world of elementary
particles? This question is interwoven with the various tau physics topics.
These topics are: searching for unexpected tau decay modes; searching for
additional tau decay mechanisms; radiative tau decays; tau decay modes of the
W, B, and D; decay of the Z^0 to tau pairs; searching for CP violation in tau
decay; the tau neutrino, dreams and odd ideas in tau physics; and tau research
facilities in the next decades.

Types of Paradox in Physics,http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.1864v1,['Dragoljub A. Cucic'],"  Paradoxes are a relatively frequent occurrence in physics. The nature of
their genesis is diverse and they are found in all branches of physics. There
are a number of general and special classifications of paradoxes, but there are
no classifications of paradoxes in physics. Nowadays, physics is a fundamental
and rather formalized science, the paradoxes of which imply falsity and
imprecision. One of the basic methods of addressing a problem is to present
classifications that facilitate its formulation and study. This work groups
together the paradoxes in physics according to certain common characteristics,
which should assist in explaining the causes for paradox formation.

Unification and Emergence in Physics: the Problem of Articulation,http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.4304v1,['Ian T. Durham'],"  What is physics? What are the limits of what physics can say about the world?
In seeking ever-broader theoretical `umbrellas' for physical phenomena, we are
seeking unifying principles. Emergent phenomena have turned out to be some of
the most difficult to explain, causing a `clash of umbrellas' so-to-speak, at
the interface between the quantum and classical domains. This essay explores
the role of articulation in this particularly vexing problem and ultimately
addresses the question of whether the language and mathematics we use to
describe the universe is sufficient in its present form and application.

wavefunction in a chosen spatial basis by minimizing the accumulated action.
Introduction of a finite temporal basis reduces the problem to a set of linear
equations, while an appropriate choice of temporal basis set offers improved
convergence relative to methods based on matrix exponentiation for a class of

physics students can translate into specific beliefs about quantum phenomena
when taking an introductory modern physics course. Student beliefs regarding
the interpretation of quantum mechanics often vary by context, and are most
often in alignment with instructional goals in topic areas where instructors
are explicit in promoting a particular perspective. Moreover, students are more
likely to maintain realist perspectives in topic areas where instructors are
less explicit in addressing interpretive themes, thereby making such issues
part of a hidden curriculum. We discuss various approaches to addressing
student perspectives and interpretive themes in a modern physics course, and

of the life sciences"" curriculum centered on a draft textbook that takes a
novel approach to teaching physics to life science majors. In addition,
substantial revisions were made to the homework and hands-on components of the
course to emphasize the relationship between physics and the life sciences and
to help the students to learn to apply physical intuition to life
science-oriented problems. Student learning and attitudinal outcomes were
assessed both quantitatively, using standard physics education research
instruments, and qualitatively, using student surveys and a series of
post-semester interviews. Students experienced high conceptual learning gains,
comparable to other active learning-based physics courses. Qualitatively, a
substantial fraction of interviewed students reported an increased interest in
physics relative to the beginning of the semester. Furthermore, more than half
of students self-reported that they could now relate physics topics to their
majors and future careers, with interviewed subjects demonstrating a high level
of ability to come up with examples of how physics affects living organisms and
how it helped them to better understand content presented in courses in their
major.

How to Control a Decrease in Physics Enrollment?,http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6442v1,['Samina S Masood'],"  Physics community is generally concerned about the decrease in Physics
enrollment. Due to the deficiency of specially qualified Physics teachers, high
school Physics is sometimes taught by general science teachers who may not be
trained to motivate students to study Physics. These students will neither be
inclined to register into Physics courses nor plan to teach Physics. They will
be unable to find out the relevance of Physics with daily life, its application
in different disciplines and even the job market. In this situation, we have to
carefully make the existing Physics programs more attractive, instead of
closing them down. We discuss teaching methodology and course requirements that
will help to make Physics programs more attractive and preferable for incoming
students. However, we emphasize to set our goals and plan to increase
enrollment in parallel steps such as proper information about the program, help
in developing a required mathematics background, offering scholarships,
teaching assistantship or internships and involving them in research. Also we
need to make Physics programs more interesting with the interdisciplinary
courses and other electives which students may like. We will have to work on
the retention rate to maintain enrollment without compromising on standards.
However, we still have to develop a complete understanding of the problem and
keep looking for a better solution.

The roots of physics students' motivations: Fear and Integrity,http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04256v1,['Ben Van Dusen'],"  Too often, physics students are beset by feelings of failure and isolation
rather than experiencing the creative joys of discovery that physics has to
offer. This dissertation research was founded on the desire of a teacher to
make physics class exciting and motivating to his students. This work explores
how various aspects of learning environments interact with student motivation.
This work uses qualitative and quantitative methods to explore how students are
motivated to engage in physics and how they feel about themselves while
engaging in physics. The collection of four studies in this dissertation
culminates in a sociocultural perspective on motivation and identity. This
perspective uses two extremes of how students experience physics as a lens for
understanding motivation: fear and self-preservation versus integrity and
self-expression. Rather than viewing motivation as a property of the student,
or viewing students as inherently interested or disinterested in physics, the
theoretical perspective on motivation and identity helps examine features of
the learning environments that determine how students experience themselves
through physics class. This perspective highlights the importance of feeling a
sense of belonging in the context of physics and the power that teachers have
in shaping student motivations through the construction of their classroom
learning environments. Findings demonstrate how different ways that students
experience themselves in physics class impact their performance and interest in
physics. This dissertation concludes with a set of design principles that can
foster integration and integrity among students in physics learning
environments.

Surveying Graduate Students' Attitudes and Approaches to Problem Solving,http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03478v1,"['Andrew Mason', 'Chandralekha Singh']","  Students' attitudes and approaches to problem solving in physics can
profoundly influence their motivation to learn and development of expertise. We
developed and validated an Attitudes and Approaches to Problem Solving survey
by expanding the Attitudes towards Problem Solving survey of Marx and Cummings
and administered it to physics graduate students. Comparison of their responses
to the survey questions about problem solving in their own graduate level
courses vs. problem solving in the introductory physics courses provides
insight into their expertise in introductory and graduate level physics. The
physics graduate students' responses to the survey questions were also compared
with those of introductory physics and astronomy students and physics faculty.
We find that, even for problem solving in introductory physics, graduate
students' responses to some survey questions are less expert-like than those of
the physics faculty. Comparison of survey responses of graduate students and
introductory students for problem solving in introductory physics suggests that
graduate students' responses are in general more expert-like than those of
introductory students. However, survey responses suggest that graduate-level
problem solving by graduate students on several measures has remarkably similar
trends to introductory-level problem solving by introductory students.

"Analogue-digital systems and the modular decomposition of physical
  behaviour",http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05539v1,"['E. J. Beggs', 'J. V. Tucker']","  We take a fresh look at analogue-digital systems focussing on their physical
behaviour. We model a general analogue-digital system as a physical process
controlled by an algorithm by viewing the physical process as physical oracle
to the algorithm, generalising the notion of Turing. We develop a theoretical
framework for the specification and analysis of such systems that combines five
semantical notions: actual physical behaviour, measured behaviour, predicted
behaviour, computed behaviour and exceptional behaviour. Next, we consider the
more general and applicable situation of complex processes that exhibit several
distinct modes of physical behaviour. Thus, for their design, a set of
mathematical models may be needed, each model having its own domain of
application and representing a particular mode of behaviour or operation of
physical reality with its own physical oracle. The models may be of disparate
kinds and, furthermore, not all physical modes may even have a reliable model.
We address the questions: How do we specify algorithms and software that
monitor or govern a complex physical situation with many physical modes? How do
we specify a portfolio of modes, and the computational problem of transitioning
from using one mode to another mode as physical behaviour changes? We propose a
general definition of an analogue-digital system with modes, and show how any
diverse set of modes, with or without models, can be bound together, and how
the transitions between modes can be determined, by constructing a data type
and mode selection functions. We illustrate the ideas of physical modes and our
theory by reflecting on simple examples, including driverless racing cars.

properties of quark-hadron many-body systems. The QNP is an international
conference which covers a wide range of hadron and nuclear physics, including
quark and gluon structure of hadrons, hadron spectroscopy, hadron interactions
and nuclear structure, hot and cold dense matter, and experimental facilities.
First, I introduce the current status of the hadron and nuclear physics field
related to this conference. Next, the organization of the conference is
explained, and a brief overview of major recent developments is discussed by
selecting topics from discussions at the plenary sessions. They include
rapidly-developing field of gravitational waves and nuclear physics, hadron
interactions and nuclear structure with strangeness, lattice QCD, hadron
spectroscopy, nucleon structure, heavy-ion physics, hadrons in nuclear medium,
and experimental facilities of EIC, GSI-FAIR, JLab, J-PARC, Super-KEKB, and
others. Nuclear physics is at a fortunate time to push various projects at
these facilities. However, we should note that the projects need to be
developed together with related studies in other fields such as gravitational
physics, astrophysics, condensed-matter physics, particle physics, and

First Steps into Physics in the Winery,http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.3767v1,"['Roberto Benedetti', 'Emilio Mariotti', 'Vera Montalbano']","  Physics is introduced as a basic matter in the curricula of professional
schools (i.e. schools for agriculture, electronic or chemistry experts).
Students meet physics in the early years of their training and then continue in
vocational subjects where many physics' topics can be useful. Rarely, however,
the connection between physics and professional matters is quite explicit.
Students often feel physics as boring and useless, i.e. very far from their
interests. In these schools it is almost always required the physics lab, but
it does not always exist. The physics teachers of a local Agricultural
Technical Institute asked us to realize a learning path in laboratory for their
students, since in their school the physics lab was missing. This institute is
the only public school in the Chianti area specializing in Viticulture and
Enology, and attending a further year post diploma, allows the achievement of
the qualification of Enologist. We report a learning path realized starting
from thermal equilibrium to a full understanding of the measures made with the
Malligand's ebulliometer, used for determining the alcoholic strength (alcohol
concentration by volume) of an alcoholic beverage and water/alcohol solutions
in general. The aim was to make interesting measures of physical quantities,
calorimetry and state transitions connecting them to the functioning of an
instrument that students use in their professional career. The feedback of
students and the interests of their teachers convinced us to go further in this
way. We intend in the next future to involve teachers of physics and vocational
subjects in the design of a physics curriculum spread over two years in which
the main physics topics will be introduced to explain the functioning of tools
and equipment used, normally, in the winery.

"Analysis of the equations of mathematical physics and foundations of
  field theories with the help of skew-symmetric differential forms",http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0512072v1,['L. I. Petrova'],"  In the paper it is shown that, even without a knowledge of the concrete form
of the equations of mathematical physics and field theories, with the help of
skew-symmetric differential forms one can see specific features of the
equations of mathematical physics, the relation between mathematical physics
and field theory, to understand the mechanism of evolutionary processes that
develop in material media and lead to emergency of physical structures forming
physical fields. This discloses a physical meaning of such concepts like
""conservation laws"", ""postulates"" and ""causality"" and gives answers to many
principal questions of mathematical physics and general field theory.
  In present paper, beside the exterior forms, the skew-symmetric differential
forms, whose basis (in contrast to the exterior forms) are deforming manifolds,
are used. Mathematical apparatus of such differential forms(which were named
evolutionary ones) includes nontraditional elements like nonidentical relations
and degenerate transformations and this enables one to describe discrete

Deformation principle and further geometrization of physics,http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.3003v1,['Yuri A. Rylov'],"  The space-time geometry is considered to be a physical geometry, i.e. a
geometry described completely by the world function. All geometrical concepts
and geometric objects are taken from the proper Euclidean geometry. They are
expressed via the Euclidean world function \sigma_E and declared to be concepts
and objects of any physical geometry, provided the Euclidean world function
\sigma_E is replaced by the world function \sigma of the physical geometry in
question. The set of physical geometries is more powerful, than the set of
Riemannian geometries, and one needs to choose a true space-time geometry. In
general, the physical geometry is multivariant (there are many vectors which
are equivalent to a given vector, but are not equivalent between themselves).
The multivariance admits one to describe quantum effects as geometric effects
and to consider existence of elementary particles as a geometrical problem,
when the possibility of the physical existence of an elementary geometric
object in the form of a physical body is determined by the space-time geometry.
Multivariance admits one to describe discrete and continuous geometries, using
the same technique. A use of physical geometry admits one to realize the
geometrical approach to the quantum theory and to the theory of elementary
particles.

"The Computational Status of Physics: A Computable Formulation of Quantum
  Theory",http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.1443v3,['Mike Stannett'],"  According to the Church-Turing Thesis (CTT), effective formal behaviours can
be simulated by Turing machines; this has naturally led to speculation that
physical systems can also be simulated computationally. But is this wider claim
true, or do behaviours exist which are strictly hypercomputational? Several
idealised computational models are known which suggest the possibility of
hypercomputation, some Newtonian, some based on cosmology, some on quantum
theory. While these models' physicality is debatable, they nonetheless throw
into question the validity of extending CTT to include all physical systems. We
consider the physicality of hypercomputational behaviour from first principles,
by showing that quantum theory can be reformulated in a way that explains why
physical behaviours can be regarded as 'computing something' in the standard
computational state-machine sense. While this does not rule out the physicality
of hypercomputation, it strongly limits the forms it can take. Our model also
has physical consequences; in particular, the continuity of motion and arrow of
time become theorems within the basic model.

"Two types of conservation laws. Connection of physical fields with
  material systems. Peculiarities of field theories",http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.0514v1,['L. I. Petrova'],"  Historically it happen so that in branches of physics connected with field
theory and of physics of material systems (continuous media) the concept of
""conservation laws"" has a different meaning. In field theory ""conservation
laws"" are those that claim the existence of conservative physical quantities or
objects. These are conservation laws for physical fields. In contrast to that
in physics (and mechanics) of material systems the concept of ""conservation
laws"" relates to conservation laws for energy, linear momentum, angular
momentum, and mass that establish the balance between the change of physical
quantities and external action.
  In the paper presented it is proved that there exist a connection between of
conservation laws for physical fields and those for material systems. This
points to the fact that physical fields are connected with material systems.
Such results has an unique significance for field theories. This enables one to
substantiate many basic principles of field theories, such as, for example, the
unity of existing field theories and the causality. The specific feature of
field theory equations, namely, their connection to the equations for material
systems, is elicited. Such results have been obtained by using skew-symmetric
differential forms, which reflect the properties of conservation laws.

Are there alternatives to our present theories of physical reality?,http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.3433v1,['Peter Rowlands'],"  Our notions of what is physically 'real' have long been based on the idea
that the real is what is immediately apprehended, that is the local or
observable, the physically tangible, though there has always been an
alternative philosophical notion that the 'real' is some kind of ontological
structure beyond immediate apprehension, and so inaccessible through physics.
However, quantum mechanics, with its intrinsic nonlocal correlations, has
seemingly left us with a dilemma by showing that fundamental physical theories
cannot be both real and local. Reality cannot be reconstructed as a
deterministic projection from physical observations. Many people think that the
problem lies with quantum mechanics, but, in fact, it is more likely to be a
result of unrealistic expectations. We have assumed that fundamental physics
ought to be compatible with normal (macroscopic) experience. If, however, we go
beyond our current high-level physical theories to the basic elements from
which they are constructed, we see that a pattern emerges that gives us a very
different and much more coherent understanding of what is meant by physical
'reality'.

suggestive for the resolution of one of mathematics' most famous unconfirmed

solution for this more than hundred-year-old problem? In this work we examine
numerous models from different branches of physics, from classical mechanics to
statistical physics, where this function plays an integral role. We also see
how this function is related to quantum chaos and how its pole-structure
encodes when particles can undergo Bose-Einstein condensation at low
temperature. Throughout these examinations we highlight how physics can perhaps
shed light on the Riemann Hypothesis. Naturally, our aim could not be to be

how successful the methods were. After several years, we have a compilation of
techniques in our teaching toolbox. New teachers are at a disadvantage because
they have fewer prior experiences to draw upon. Luckily, there is a group of
physicists and physics educators who are researching how students learn
physics, and have been able to show evidence of effective education practices
in physics. They field of study is called PER: Physics Education Research. I
asked Chandralekha Singh, one of the leaders in PER, to summarize some of the
most relevant PER findings and her response follows.

"Laboratory Space Physics: Investigating the Physics of Space Plasmas in
  the Laboratory",http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04154v1,['Gregory G. Howes'],"  Laboratory experiments provide a valuable complement to explore the
fundamental physics of space plasmas without the limitations inherent to
spacecraft measurements. Specifically, experiments overcome the restriction
that spacecraft measurements are made at only one (or a few) points in space,
enable greater control of the plasma conditions and applied perturbations, can
be reproducible, and are orders of magnitude less expensive than launching
spacecraft. Here I highlight key open questions about the physics of space
plasmas and identify the aspects of these problems that can potentially be
tackled in laboratory experiments. Several past successes in laboratory space
physics provide concrete examples of how complementary experiments can
contribute to our understanding of physical processes at play in the solar
corona, solar wind, planetary magnetospheres, and outer boundary of the
heliosphere. I present developments on the horizon of laboratory space physics,
identifying velocity space as a key new frontier, highlighting new and enhanced
experimental facilities, and showcasing anticipated developments to produce
improved diagnostics and innovative analysis methods. A strategy for future
laboratory space physics investigations will be outlined, with explicit
connections to specific fundamental plasma phenomena of interest.

An uncommon case of relevance through everyday experiences,http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10417v1,"['Abhilash Nair', 'Vashti Sawtelle']","  Physics education research has probed for the relevance of physics in
students' everyday lives. Attitudinal and epistemological surveys have asked
students if they think of or use physics in their daily lives. We have
previously documented how it is uncommon that our life science students
describe using or even seeing physics in their daily life (Nair, 2018). This
result was unsurprising and aligns with previous scholarship of students
majoring in disciplines outside of physics; we have argued that it is
optimistic for scholars to expect students with disciplinary homes outside of
physics to see their experiences through a lens of physics. Methodologically,
we searched for a contrasting case (Sam). Sam is majoring in the life sciences
and articulates moments where she uses physics to reason through everyday
phenomena. We explore the ways in which courses can support students like Sam
to find physics relevant to their everyday experiences.

that combines RNNs and physics-based models to leverage their complementary
strengths and improve the modeling of physical processes. Specifically, we show
that a PGRNN can improve prediction accuracy over that of physical models,
while generating outputs consistent with physical laws, and achieving good
generalizability. Standard RNNs, even when producing superior prediction
accuracy, often produce physically inconsistent results and lack
generalizability. We further enhance this approach by using a pre-training
method that leverages the simulated data from a physics-based model to address
the scarcity of observed data. The PGRNN has the flexibility to incorporate
additional physical constraints and we incorporate a density-depth
relationship. Both enhancements further improve PGRNN performance. Although we
present and evaluate this methodology in the context of modeling the dynamics
of temperature in lakes, it is applicable more widely to a range of scientific
and engineering disciplines where mechanistic (also known as process-based)
models are used, e.g., power engineering, climate science, materials science,

"Killing Science Fiction: Why Conscious States Cannot Be Copied or
  Repeated",http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02813v1,['Andrew Knight'],"  Several philosophical problems arising from the physics of consciousness,
including identity, duplication, teleportation, simulation, self-location, and
the Boltzmann Brain problem, hinge on one of the most deeply held but
unnecessary convictions of physicalism: the assumption that brain states and
their corresponding conscious states can in principle be copied. In this paper
I will argue against this assumption by attempting to prove the Unique History
Theorem, which states, essentially, that conscious correlations to underlying
quantum mechanical measurement events must increase with time and that every
conscious state uniquely determines its history from an earlier conscious
state. By assuming only that consciousness arises from an underlying physical
state, I will argue that the physical evolution from a first physical state
giving rise to a conscious state to a second physical state giving rise to a
later conscious state is unique. Among the consequences of this theorem are
that: consciousness is not algorithmic and a conscious state cannot be uploaded
to or simulated by a digital computer; a conscious state cannot be copied by
duplicating a brain or any other physical state; and a conscious state cannot
be repeated or created de novo. These conclusions shed light on the physical
nature of consciousness by rendering moot a variety of seemingly paradoxical
philosophy and science fiction problems.

  Einstein's conceptions of physical theories. Quantum physics as a theory of
  general relativity of experimental context",http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07338v1,['Thierry Batard'],"  In glaring contrast to its indisputable century-old experimental success, the
ultimate objects and meaning of quantum physics remain a matter of vigorous
debate among physicists and philosophers of science. This article attempts to
shed new light on the debate. It relies upon two comments by Albert Einstein on
his general approach to physical theories. I draw their consequences for the
definition of a physical theory's ontology, and next for the ontology of
quantum physics - i.e. what it may ultimately be about. The quantum ontology
thus derived appears to be strictly limited to evolving experimental contexts
and instantaneous measurement outcomes, which are to be understood,
respectively, as mere potential measurement outcomes and actual ones. The
notions of material body in particular and physical system in general are
absent from this ontology, hence the vanishing of Schroedinger's cat and EPR
paradoxes, as well as of the quantum measurement problem. Apart from its
ability to clear up well-known conundrums, this ontology reveals what quantum
physics may fundamentally be - i.e. its possible ultimate meaning - namely a
theory of general relativity of experimental context. On this basis, I conclude
with a new conception of objectivity in the sciences of nature.

strongly interacting many-body systems with an extended hadronic degree of
freedom, strangeness, to new forms of hadrons and hadronic matters. These

possibly, to understand fundamental interactions because of recent progress on
AdS/CFT correspondence. At the first stage of the J-PARC operation, hadron
topics are mainly on strangeness nuclear physics such as hypernuclei, kaonic
nuclei, and possible pentaquark hadrons. Then, the studies could be extended to
exotic hadron searches, chiral dynamics in nuclear medium, structure functions,
hard exclusive processes, hadron physics in neutrino scattering, and spin
structure of the nucleon. With major upgrades of the facility, extensive
studies could be done for the nucleon spin, heavy-ion physics, and hadron
physics at a high-energy neutrino factory.

Language is Physical,http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0210211v1,['Paul Benioff'],"  Some aspects of the physical nature of language are discussed. In particular,
physical models of language must exist that are efficiently implementable. The
existence requirement is essential because without physical models no
communication or thinking would be possible. Efficient implementability for
creating and reading language expressions is discussed and illustrated with a
quantum mechanical model. The reason for interest in language is that language
expressions can have meaning, either as an informal language or as a formal
language associated with a mathematical or physical theory. It is noted that
any universally applicable physical theory, or coherent theory of physics and
mathematics together, includes in its domain physical models of expressons for
both the informal language used to discuss the theory and expressions of the
theory itself. It follows that there must be formulas in the formal theory that
express some of their own physical properties. Inclusion of intelligent system
in the theory domain means that the theory, e.g., quantum mechanics, must
describe in some sense its own validation. Maps of language expressions into
physical states are discussed as are conditions under which such a map is a
Godel map. The possibility that language is also mathematical is very briefly
discussed.

  students' attitudes towards physics",http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.1759v2,"['Gintaras Duda', 'Katherine Garrett']","  Even though there has been a tremendous amount of research done in how to
help students learn physics, students are still coming away missing a crucial
piece of the puzzle: why bother with physics? Students learn fundamental laws
and how to calculate, but come out of a general physics course without a deep
understanding of how physics has transformed the world around them. In other
words, they get the ""how"" but not the ""why"". Studies have shown that students
leave introductory physics courses almost universally with decreased
expectations and with a more negative attitude. This paper will detail an
experiment to address this problem: a course weblog or ""blog"" which discusses
real-world applications of physics and engages students in discussion and
thinking outside of class. Specifically, students' attitudes towards the value
of physics and its applicability to the real-world were probed using a

students who did not participate in the blog study generally exhibited a
deterioration in attitude towards physics as seen previously. However, students

"What is Physics: The individual and the universal, and seeing past the
  noise",http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03106v1,['A. R. P. Rau'],"  Along with weaving together observations, experiments, and theoretical
constructs into a coherent mesh of understanding of the world around us,
physics over its past five centuries has continuously refined the base concepts
on which the whole framework is built. In quantum physics, first in
non-relativistic mechanics and later in quantum field theories, even familiar
concepts of position, momentum, wave or particle, are derived constructs from
the classical limit in which we live but not intrinsic to the underlying
physics. Most crucially, the very idea of the individual, whether an object or
an event, distinguished only in a mere label of identity from others identical
to it in all the physics, exists only as an approximation, not an element of
underlying reality. Failure to recognize this and seeking alternative
explanations in many worlds or multiverses leads only to incoherent logic and
incorrect physics.
  As an example, in a physical system such as an atom in a particular state,
physics deals with the universal system of all such atoms but makes no
meaningful prediction of the position of an electron or the time of decay of
any specific atom. Those are incidental, entirely random among all possible
positions and times, even while physics makes very precise predictions for the
distribution of the outcomes in measurements on atoms in that state. Physics
deals with the universal, not the individual.

When does a physical system compute?,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.7979v3,"['Clare Horsman', 'Susan Stepney', 'Rob C. Wagner', 'Viv Kendon']","  Computing is a high-level process of a physical system. Recent interest in
non-standard computing systems, including quantum and biological computers, has
brought this physical basis of computing to the forefront. There has been,
however, no consensus on how to tell if a given physical system is acting as a
computer or not; leading to confusion over novel computational devices, and
even claims that every physical event is a computation. In this paper we
introduce a formal framework that can be used to determine whether or not a
physical system is performing a computation. We demonstrate how the abstract
computational level interacts with the physical device level, drawing the
comparison with the use of mathematical models to represent physical objects in
experimental science. This powerful formulation allows a precise description of
the similarities between experiments, computation, simulation, and technology,
leading to our central conclusion: physical computing is the use of a physical
system to predict the outcome of an abstract evolution. We give conditions that
must be satisfied in order for computation to be occurring, and illustrate
these with a range of non-standard computing scenarios. The framework also
covers broader computing contexts, where there is no obvious human computer
user. We define the critical notion of a 'computational entity', and show the
role this plays in defining when computing is taking place in physical systems.

  This allows us to explain the general structure of the Lagrangian for a
composite physical system, as well as some other artificial postulates behind
the variational formulations of physical laws.
  As an example, we derive Hamilton's principle of stationary action together
with the Lagrangians for the cases of Newtonian mechanics, relativistic

This phase leads to the Bargmann's superselection rule, which forbids the

unstable particles cannot be described consistently in non-relativistic quantum

also to classical mechanics, to establish that it requires a commitment to

Exceptional points of the Lindblad operator of a two-level system,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04676v2,['Naomichi Hatano'],"  The Lindblad equation for a two-level system under an electric field is
analyzed by mapping to a linear equation with a non-Hermitian matrix.
Exceptional points of the matrix are found to be extensive; the second-order
ones are located on lines in a two-dimensional parameter space, while the

Physical projectors for multi-leg helicity amplitudes,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03298v1,"['Tiziano Peraro', 'Lorenzo Tancredi']","  We present a method for building physical projector operators for multi-leg
helicity amplitudes. For any helicity configuration of the external particles,
we define a physical projector which singles out the corresponding helicity
amplitude. For processes with more than four external legs, these physical
projectors depend on significantly fewer tensor structures and exhibit a
remarkable simplicity compared with projector operators defined with
traditional approaches. As an example, we present analytic formulas for a
complete set of projectors for five-gluon scattering. These have been validated
by reproducing known results for five-gluon amplitudes up to one-loop.

Perspectives of photon physics at future colliders,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09280v1,['M. Klasen'],"  We review current results on physics with photons at the LHC and discuss
realistic perspectives of photon physics at future colliders. In particular, we
focus on Standard Model (SM) measurements with photons at the upcoming
high-luminosity and a possible high-energy LHC as well as jet measurements at
an Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) to be constructed either at BNL or at JLAB and
their potential to constrain nuclear parton densities. We also discuss future
searches for physics beyond the SM with photons in the high-luminosity phase of
the LHC.

Neutrino Physics in Historical Context,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10324v1,['Quentin Rodriguez'],"  This contribution aims to give an overview of the historical context of
neutrino physics. I will present the strong social trends that shaped physics
and the way physicists worked, along the 20th century. First, we will see the
background of the birth of nuclear physics in the interwar period. Then, we
will examine the deep implications the Second World War had, to conclude with
the specificities of postwar years for nuclear and particle physics.

yet they may produce physically-inconsistent results when violating fundamental
constraints. In this letter, we introduce a systematic way of enforcing
analytic constraints in neural networks via constraints in the architecture or
the loss function. Applied to the modeling of convective processes for climate
modeling, architectural constraints can enforce conservation laws to within
machine precision without degrading performance. Furthermore, enforcing
constraints can reduce the error of variables closely related to the
constraints.

Real Numbers are the Hidden Variables of Classical Mechanics,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04514v1,['Nicolas Gisin'],"  Do scientific theories limit human knowledge? In other words, are there
physical variables hidden by essence forever? We argue for negative answers and
illustrate our point on chaotic classical dynamical systems. We emphasize
parallels with quantum theory and conclude that the common real numbers are, de
facto, the hidden variables of classical physics. Consequently, real numbers
should not be considered as ""physically real"" and classical mechanics, like
quantum physics, is indeterministic.

Why dimensionless units should not be used in physics,http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10030v2,['Petr Křen'],"  The quantities of dimension one - known as the dimensionless quantities - are
widely used in physics. However, the debate about some dimensionless units is
still open. The paper brings new interrelated arguments that lead to the
conclusion to avoid physical dimensionless units, except one for the
mathematical multiplication identity element that should not be introduced into
a system of physical units. It brings the coherence to the International System
of Units (SI) and it will remove ambiguities rising from the conflict between
the mathematical properties and the physical conventions.

governing parameters (e.g. velocities). We evaluate our ability to discover
physical laws on videos of elementary physical phenomena, such as projectile
motion or circular motion. These elementary tasks have textbook governing

"Tasi lectures: weak scale supersymmetry - a top-motivated-bottom-up
  approach",http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0202185v2,['Gordon L. Kane'],"  Introduction, Perspective - since particle physics beyond the SM is presently
in an incoherent state, with lots of static, a long introduction is needed,
including some history of the supersymmetry revolutions, physics not described
by the SM, indirect evidence for low energy supersymmetry and how flavor
physics should be approached. Derive the supersymmetric Lagrangian - the
superpotential W. Soft supersymmetry breaking - underlying physics - the
general soft-breaking Lagrangian - the MSSM. The \mu opportunity - R-parity
conservation. Count of parameters - constraints - measuring the parameters.
Connecting the weak and unification scale. Derivation of the Higgs mechanism -
in what sense does supersymmetry explain the Higgs physics.
  The Higgs spectrum - \tan\beta, Yukawa couplings, constraints. LEP Higgs
physics - Tevatron Higgs physics can confirm the Higgs mechanism and coupling
proportional to mass - measurements in the Higgs sector. gluino, Neutralino,
Chargino - cannot in general measure \tan\beta at hadron colliders. Effects of
soft phases - all observables, not only CPV ones, g-2, EDMs, gluino phase, LSP
CDM, possible connections to stringy physics. Phase structure of simple D-brane
models. Tevatron superpartner searches, signatures. Extensions of the MSSM. The
importance of low scale supersymmetry is not only that we learn of another
profound aspect of our world, but also to provide a window to Planck scale
physics, in order to connect string theory and our world.

Physics of Caustics and Protein Folding: Mathematical Parallels,http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.2740v1,"['Walter Simmons', 'Joel L. Weiner']","  The energy for protein folding arises from multiple sources and is not large
in total. In spite of the many specific successes of energy landscape and other
approaches, there still seems to be some missing guiding factor that explains
how energy from diverse small sources can drive a complex molecule to a unique
state. We explore the possibility that the missing factor is in the geometry.
  A comparison of folding with other physical phenomena, together with analytic
modeling of a molecule, led us to analyze the physics of optical caustic
formation and of folding behavior side-by-side. The physics of folding and
caustics is ostensibly very different but there are several strong parallels.
This comparison emphasizes the mathematical similarity and also identifies
differences. Since the 1970's, the physics of optical caustics has been
developed to a very high degree of mathematical sophistication using
catastrophe theory. That kind of quantitative application of catastrophe theory
has not previously been applied to folding nor have the points of similarity
with optics been identified or exploited.
  A putative underlying physical link between caustics and folding is a torsion
wave of non-constant wave speed, propagating on the dihedral angles and $\Psi$
found in an analytical model of the molecule.
  Regardless of whether we have correctly identified an underlying link, the
analogy between caustic formation and folding is strong and the parallels (and
differences) in the physics are useful.

Refined Characterization of Student Perspectives on Quantum Physics,http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.5800v1,"['Charles Baily', 'Noah D. Finkelstein']","  The perspectives of introductory classical physics students can often
negatively influence how those students later interpret quantum phenomena when
taking an introductory course in modern physics. A detailed exploration of
student perspectives on the interpretation of quantum physics is needed, both
to characterize student understanding of physics concepts, and to inform how we
might teach traditional content. Our previous investigations of student
perspectives on quantum physics have indicated they can be highly nuanced, and
may vary both within and across contexts. In order to better understand the
contextual and often seemingly contradictory stances of students on matters of
interpretation, we interviewed 19 students from four introductory modern
physics courses taught at the University of Colorado. We find that students
have attitudes and opinions that often parallel the stances of expert
physicists when arguing for their favored interpretations of quantum mechanics,
allowing for more nuanced characterizations of student perspectives in terms of
three key interpretive themes. We present a framework for characterizing
student perspectives on quantum mechanics, and demonstrate its utility in
interpreting the sometimes-contradictory nature of student responses to
previous surveys. We further find that students most often vacillate in their
responses when what makes intuitive sense to them is not in agreement with what
they consider to be a correct response, underscoring the need to distinguish

"Exploring Pedagogical Content Knowledge of Physics Instructors and
  Teaching Assistants Using the Force Concept Inventory",http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7177v1,"['Alexandru Maries', 'Chandralekha Singh']","  The Force Concept Inventory (FCI) has been widely used to assess student
understanding of introductory mechanics concepts by a variety of educators and
physics education researchers. One reason for this extensive use is that many
of the items on the FCI have strong distractor choices that correspond to
students' alternate conceptions in mechanics. Instruction is unlikely to be
effective if instructors do not know the common alternate conceptions of
introductory physics students and explicitly take into account students'
initial knowledge state in their instructional design. Here, we discuss
research involving the FCI to evaluate the pedagogical content knowledge of
both instructors and teaching assistants (TAs) of varying teaching experience.
For each item on the FCI, the instructors and TAs were asked to identify the
most common incorrect answer choice of introductory physics students. We also
discussed the responses individually with a few instructors. Then, we used the
FCI pre-test and post-test data from a large population (~900) of introductory
physics students to assess the pedagogical content knowledge of physics
instructors and TAs. We find that while both physics instructors and TAs, on
average, performed better than random guessing at identifying introductory
students' difficulties with FCI content, they did not identify many common
difficulties that introductory physics students have, even after traditional
instruction. Moreover, the ability to correctly identify students' difficulties
was not correlated with the teaching experience of the physics instructors.

Students' views about the nature of experimental physics,http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04226v1,"['Bethany R. Wilcox', 'H. J. Lewandowski']","  The physics community explores and explains the physical world through a
blend of theoretical and experimental studies. The future of physics as a
discipline depends on training of students in both the theoretical and
experimental aspects of the field. However, while student learning within
lecture courses has been the subject of extensive research, lab courses remain
relatively under-studied. In particular, there is little, if any, data
available that addresses the effectiveness of physics lab courses at
encouraging students to recognize the nature and importance of experimental
physics within the discipline as a whole. To address this gap, we present the
first large-scale, national study ($N_{institutions}=75$ and
$N_{students}=7167$) of undergraduate physics lab courses through analysis of
students' responses to a research-validated assessment designed to investigate
students' beliefs about the nature of experimental physics. We find that
students often enter and leave physics lab courses with ideas about
experimental physics as practiced in their courses that are inconsistent with
the views of practicing experimental physicists, and this trend holds at both
the introductory and upper-division levels. Despite this inconsistency, we find
that both introductory and upper-division students are able to accurately
predict the expert-like response even in cases where their views about
experimentation in their lab courses disagree. These finding have implications
for the recruitment, retention, and adequate preparation of students in
physics.

"A Learning Based Approach for Uncertainty Analysis in Numerical Weather
  Prediction Models",http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08055v1,"['Azam Moosavi', 'Vishwas Rao', 'Adrian Sandu']","  Complex numerical weather prediction models incorporate a variety of physical
processes, each described by multiple alternative physical schemes with
specific parameters. The selection of the physical schemes and the choice of
the corresponding physical parameters during model configuration can
significantly impact the accuracy of model forecasts. There is no combination
of physical schemes that works best for all times, at all locations, and under
all conditions. It is therefore of considerable interest to understand the
interplay between the choice of physics and the accuracy of the resulting
forecasts under different conditions. This paper demonstrates the use of
machine learning techniques to study the uncertainty in numerical weather
prediction models due to the interaction of multiple physical processes. The
first problem addressed herein is the estimation of systematic model errors in
output quantities of interest at future times, and the use of this information
to improve the model forecasts. The second problem considered is the
identification of those specific physical processes that contribute most to the
forecast uncertainty in the quantity of interest under specified meteorological
conditions.
  The discrepancies between model results and observations at past times are
used to learn the relationships between the choice of physical processes and
the resulting forecast errors. Numerical experiments are carried out with the
Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The output quantity of interest
is the model precipitation, a variable that is both extremely important and
very challenging to forecast. The physical processes under consideration
include various micro-physics schemes, cumulus parameterizations, short wave,
and long wave radiation schemes. The experiments demonstrate the strong
potential of machine learning approaches to aid the study of model errors.

"Hermione and the Secretary: How gendered task division in introductory
  physics labs can disrupt equitable learning",http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06827v1,"['Danny Doucette', 'Russell Clark', 'Chandralekha Singh']","  Physics labs provide a unique opportunity for students to grow their physics
identity and science identity in general since they provide students with
opportunity to tinker with experiments and analyze data in a low-stakes
environment. However, it is important to ensure that all students are
benefiting from the labs equally and have a positive growth trajectory. Through
interviews and reflexive ethnographic observations, we identify and analyze two
common modes of work that may disadvantage female students in introductory
physics labs. Students who adopt the Secretary archetype are relegated to
recording and analyzing data, and thus miss out on much of the opportunity to
grow their physics and science identities by engaging fully in the experimental
work. Meanwhile, students in the Hermione mode shoulder a disproportionate
amount of managerial work, and also do not get adequate opportunity to engage
with different aspects of the experimental work that are essential for helping
them develop their physics and science identities. Using a physics identity
framework, we analyze interviews and observational data to investigate how
students under these modes of work may experience stunted growth in their
physics and science identity trajectories in their physics lab course. This
stunted growth then perpetuates and reinforces societal stereotypes and biases
about who does physics. This categorization not only gives a vocabulary to
discussions about equity in the lab, but can also serve as a useful touchstone
for those who seek to center equity in efforts to transform physics
instruction.

"Physics without Determinism: Alternative Interpretations of Classical
  Physics",http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03697v2,"['Flavio Del Santo', 'Nicolas Gisin']","  Classical physics is generally regarded as deterministic, as opposed to
quantum mechanics that is considered the first theory to have introduced
genuine indeterminism into physics. We challenge this view by arguing that the
alleged determinism of classical physics relies on the tacit, metaphysical
assumption that there exists an actual value of every physical quantity, with
its infinite predetermined digits (which we name \emph{principle of infinite
precision}). Building on recent information-theoretic arguments showing that
the principle of infinite precision (which translates into the attribution of a
physical meaning to mathematical real numbers) leads to unphysical
consequences, we consider possible alternative indeterministic interpretations
of classical physics. We also link those to well-known interpretations of
quantum mechanics. In particular, we propose a model of classical indeterminism
based on \emph{finite information quantities} (FIQs). Moreover, we discuss the
perspectives that an indeterministic physics could open (such as strong
emergence), as well as some potential problematic issues. Finally, we make
evident that any indeterministic interpretation of physics would have to deal
with the problem of explaining how the indeterminate values become determinate,
a problem known in the context of quantum mechanics as (part of) the ``quantum
measurement problem''. We discuss some similarities between the classical and
the quantum measurement problems, and propose ideas for possible solutions
(e.g., ``collapse models'' and ``top-down causation'').

Physics of mirror photons,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0011156v2,"['R. Foot', 'A. Yu. Ignatiev', 'R. R. Volkas']","  The physics of kinetic mixing between ordinary and mirror photons is
discussed. An important role is played by four linear combinations we dub the
physical photon, the sterile photon, the physical mirror photon, and the
sterile mirror photon. Because of the mass degeneracy between the two gauge
bosons, quantum coherence effects are important. The physical photon becomes a
certain coherent superposition of the bare ordinary photon and the bare mirror
photon. Similarly, the physical mirror photon is another, but {\it not
orthogonal}, coherent superposition. We discuss the physics of the interaction
between physical mirror photons and ordinary matter. Observational signatures
for some hybrid ordinary/mirror binary astrophysical systems are qualitatively
discussed. We show that a small amount of ordinary matter at the center of a
mirror star may make the mirror star observable. We speculate that the recently
reported halo white dwarfs might actually be mirror halo stars.

production. These topics are actual now due to plans of construction linear
e+e-, e-e-, gamma-gamma, gamma-e colliders with energies 0.3--1 TeV. High
energy photons for gamma-gamma, gamma-e collisions can be obtained using laser
backscattering. These types of collisions considerably increase physics
potential of linear colliders. Very low emittance of electron beams required
for achieving ultimate gamma-gamma luminosity can be obtained using a laser
cooling of electron beams. Combining a laser-electron Compton scattering with
subsequent conversion of these photons to e+e- pairs on the target (it can be a
laser target) one can get a nice source of polarized positron. In this paper,
we briefly consider these subjects with emphasis on underlying physics of

laws.
  1. The conservation laws that can be called exact ones. They point to an
avalability of some conservative quantities or objects. Such objects are the
physical structures, which the physical fields and relevant manifolds are
constructed of. These are conservation laws for physical fields.
  2. The conservation laws of energy, linear and angular momentum, and mass.
These laws are conservation laws for material systems (material media). They
establish a balance between changes of physical quantities and external
actions. Such conservation laws can be called as balance ones. It has been
shown that the exact and balance conservation laws execute a relation between
the physical structures, which form physical fields, and material systems. The
physical structures, to which the exact conservation laws correspond, are
generated by material systems in the evolutionary processes, whose moving force
is the noncommutativity of the balance conservation laws. These results are
obtained with the help of the mathematical apparatus of skew-symmetric

Specific features of differential equations of mathematical physics,http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0702019v1,['L. I. Petrova'],"  Three types of equations of mathematical physics, namely, the equations,
which describe any physical processes, the equations of mechanics and physics
of continuous media, and field-theory equations are studied in this paper.
  In the first and second case the investigation is reduced to the analysis of
the nonidentical relations of the skew-symmetric differential forms that are
obtained from differential equations. It is shown that the integrability of
equations and the properties of their solutions depend on the realization of
the conditions of degenerate transformations under which the identical
relations are obtained from the nonidentical relation.
  The field-theory equations, in contrast to the equations of first two types,
are the relations made up by skew-symmetric differential forms or their analogs
(differential or integral ones). This is due to the fact that the field-theory
equations have to describe physical structures (to which closed exterior forms
correspond) rather than physical quantities. The equations that correspond to
field theories are obtained from the equations that describe the conservation
laws (of energy, linear momentum, angular momentum, and mass) of material
systems (of continuous media). This disclose a connection between field
theories and the equations for material systems (and points to that material
media generate physical fields).

"New approach for building of unified theory about the Universe and some

operate in different phase of matter evolution and different fields of physics.
The attempts to build such wide range theory as a bunch of theories developed
for different fields of physics are not quite successful. The accumulated
knowledge from experiments and observations leads to a conclusion that some of
the adopted postulates in the modern physics are not absolutely fundamental, as
considered so far. A new approach for building of unified model of the Universe
suggests resurrection of the principles of causality and logical understanding
for any kind of physical phenomena. It is successfully applied in a new theory
titled Basic Structures of Matter, which provides fundamentals for a unified
theory about the Universe. The new approach leads to different physical models
for the elementary particles and the atoms and also to a different concept
about the Universe. In the same time the suggested models exhibit the same
interaction energies as obtained by the Quantum mechanics and experiments. The
analysis of the physical phenomena from a new point of view allows deeper
understanding of the relations between the basic physical attributes: mass,
energy, space, time, gravitation and inertia.

Causality and time-space evolution of physical systems,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0302091v1,['Enrique Ordaz Romay'],"  All physical process are subject to some laws which determine with math
accurately its time-space evolution. These laws are described, in the last
analysis for the principle of causality. The physical space can be homogeneous
or heterogeneous in function of the distribution of the physical magnitudes.
Applying the principle of causality to the homogeneous space we observe that
its more important qualities are: their metric does not depend of the
4coordeninate where it is measured and the light speed constancy [1]. However,
to apply the principle of causality in the heterogeneous space is very much
fruitful. Thanks to the presence of physical magnitudes that vary in the 4space
we can find the equations that this magnitudes should verify so that it takes
place their space and time evolution.
  Working on the principle of causality like axiom for describe our physical
systems, we will obtain the most basic expression of evolution of the
magnitudes of the physical system. This expression coincides with the principle
of action expressed for a tensorial action [2]. The scalar form of this
principle coincides, in its turn, with the traditional relativistic and quantum
expression, of the principle of action or principle of least action according
to other authors.

Concept Inventory, still struggle with fundamental concepts in mathematics and

"Enrico Fermi e Ettore Majorana: continuita' e rinnovamento
  nell'insegnamento della Fisica teorica",http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0602008v1,"['A. De Gregorio', 'S. Esposito']","  In 1927, just after he obtained a full professorship, Enrico Fermi delivered
his first course on Theoretical Physics at the Institute of Physics in Rome.
The following year Edoardo Amaldi, Emilio Segre' and Ettore Majorana became
students of that course. The lectures given in 1927-28, whose content may be
easily reconstructed, probably had a deep impact in forming such young
students, who participated actively in the Physics researches carried on in
Rome soon after. In this perspective, the case of Ettore Majorana is certainly
the most important one: as a lecturer, in 1933-36 he planned to give three
advanced Physics courses in Rome, before obtaining his full professorship in
Theoretical Physics ""for high and well-deserved repute"" in 1937. From the
analysis of the lectures he delivered in Naples in 1938, we can conclude that,
in part, Majorana referred to the Fermi lectures he followed as a student, but
he also introduced some advanced (for that time) topics, rendering his course a
very modern one. Much of these frontier topics were already cited in the
programmes of the mentioned three courses he presented few years earlier.

Physics Magic,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0606151v1,"['Nathaniel Lasry', 'Pierre-Osias Christin']","  The purpose of this paper is to show the magic of physics by showing the
physics of magic. What usually makes magic tricks interesting is that something
unexpected occurs. Similarly, demonstrations are interesting inasmuch as they
produce something unexpected. Since expectations are linked to preconceptions,
a demonstration making use of a flaw in a preconception will result in
something unexpected. Given the numerous misconceptions in physics, many
demonstrations can be dressed up as magic tricks. The first objective of this
paper is to share with other physics teachers the excitement of creating and
using magical classroom demonstrations. The second objective is to provide
interested instructors with practical means to convert a classical
demonstration into a magic trick. To illustrate the procedure, two classical
demonstrations will be re-presented as the magic tricks we have presented in
our courses. The final goal is to use current ideas in educational psychology
to explain why using magic has worked so well in our courses in providing
students with a new impetus to learn physics. This description is not meant to
be formal, but proposes a theoretical model that fits our classroom
observations.

Physicists (PFP) and a course, Teaching and Learning Physics, are designed to

reported education being valued by the research community in physics, more than

education and teaching, and engaging students in research projects in physics
education. In addition to introducing these programs, we identify some of the

undertake two other tasks. First, we explain how the proposed valuations could
arise much more generally than just in quantum physics; in particular, they
arise as naturally in classical physics. Second, we give another motivation for
such valuations (that applies equally to classical and quantum physics). This
arises from applying to propositions about the values of physical quantities

"The Implications of a Cosmological Information Bound for Complexity,
  Quantum Information and the Nature of Physical Law",http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0703041v1,['P. C. W. Davies'],"  The finite age of the universe and the existence of cosmological horizons
provides a strong argument that the observable universe represents a finite
causal region with finite material and informational resources. A similar
conclusion follows from the holographic principle. In this paper I address the
question of whether the cosmological information bound has implications for
fundamental physics. Orthodox physics is based on Platonism: the laws are
treated as infinitely precise, perfect, immutable mathematical relationships
that transcend the physical universe and remain totally unchanged by physical
processes, however extreme. If instead the laws of physics are regarded as akin
to computer software, with the physical universe as the corresponding hardware,
then the finite computational capacity of the universe imposes a fundamental
limit on the precision of the laws and the specifiability of physical states.
That limit depends on the age of the universe. I examine how the imprecision of
the laws impacts on the evolution of highly entangled states and on the problem
of dark energy.

the review is that the physics of the past three decades has been rich with new

be developed further to fully account fot the mass of strong interaction data
collected over the decades. A multitude of new phenomena have been discovered
however, or predicted theoretically, in the physics of very low temperatures
(e.g. fractional Hall effect, Bose-Einstein condensation) and quantum
macroscopic effects (liquid crystals, high temperature superconductivity), some
of which remain to be fully explained. Therefore if there is any ""Trouble with

work on Superstring theory, which may or may not turn out to agree with the

"The clouds of physics and Einstein's last query: Can quantum mechanics
  be derived from general relativity?",http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.3184v1,['Friedwardt Winterberg'],"  Towards the end of the 19th century, Kelvin pronounced as the ""clouds of
physics"" 1) the failure of the Michelson-Morely experiment to detect an ether
wind, 2) the violation of the classical mechanical equipartition theorem in
statistical thermodynamics. And he believed that the removal of these clouds
would bring physics to an end. But as we know, the removal of these clouds led
to the two great breakthoughts of modern physics: 1) The theory of relativity,
and 2) to quantum mechanics. Towards the end of the 20th century more clouds of
physics became apparent. They are 1) the riddle of quantum gravity, 2) the
superluminal quantum correlations, 3) the small cosmological constant.
Furthermore, there is the riddle of dark energy making up 70% of the physical
universe, the non-baryonic cold dark matter making up 26% and the very small
initial entropy of the universe. An attempt is made to explain the importance
of these clouds for the future of physics. Conjectures for a possible solution

Non-particle statistical physics,http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.5629v1,['A. Jakovac'],"  Consistent statistical physical description is given for systems where the
elementary excitations are composite objects. Explicit calculational scheme is
constructed for the energy density and the total number of thermodynamical
degrees of freedom, based on the spectral function of the system. One
demonstrates through characteristic examples that single quasiparticle
contributions combine non-linearly in these quantities. Relation to the Gibbs

Quantum Mechanics: Incomplete and Non Local Theory,http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0420v1,['M. Cattani'],"  We will show for undergraduate and graduate students of physics that Quantum
Mechanics is an incomplete and non-local theory. The problem of non-locality is
discussed by analyzing the Bell's theorem where are considered correlations
between measurements results performed on physical systems that are far apart,
but that interacted in the past. The experimental violations of Bell's theorem
show a very general result thatquantum phenomena are nonlocal and that,
inevitably, Quantum Mechanics is non-local.
