Is Physics Sick? [In Praise of Classical Physics],http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0592v1,['Hisham Ghassib'],"  In this paper, it is argued that theoretical physics is more akin to an
organism than to a rigid structure.It is in this sense that the epithet,
""sick"", applies to it. It is argued that classical physics is a model of a
healthy science, and the degree of sickness of modern physics is measured
accordingly. The malady is located in the relationship between mathematics and
physical meaning in physical theory.

Fundamental Dilemmas in Theoretical Physics,http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5530v1,['Hisham Ghassib'],"  In this paper, we argue that there are foundational dilemmas in theoretical
physics related to the concept of reality and the nature of mathematics in
physics. Physical theory is treated as a conceptual organism which develops
under the weight of its internal contradictions. The paper discusses in depth
the problem of objective reality in physics and its relation to scientific
practice. Then, it explores the problematic relation between physical meaning
and mathematics in modern physical theory, followed by a discussion of the
trend of contemporary physics to replace physical principles with pure
mathematical principles. Finally, it discusses the problem of logical coherence
in modern physical theory. The paper emphasizes the importance of resolving
these dilemmas to the proper practice of theoretical physics.

problems in this field are outlined. We argue that hadron physics is a distinct
subfield, no longer within particle physics, and not at all the same as
classical nuclear physics. We believe that it needs to be better organized, and
that a first step in doing so might be to establish hadron physics as a new
division within the American Physical Society.

2T-Physics 2001,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0106021v3,['Itzhak Bars'],"  The physics that is traditionally formulated in one--time-physics
(1T-physics) can also be formulated in two-time-physics (2T-physics). The
physical phenomena in 1T or 2T physics are not different, but the spacetime
formalism used to describe them is. The 2T description involves two extra
dimensions (one time and one space), is more symmetric, and makes manifest many
hidden features of 1T-physics. One such hidden feature is that families of
apparently different 1T-dynamical systems in d dimensions holographically
describe the same 2T system in d+2 dimensions. In 2T-physics there are two
timelike dimensions, but there is also a crucial gauge symmetry that thins out
spacetime, thus making 2T-physics effectively equivalent to 1T-physics. The
gauge symmetry is also responsible for ensuring causality and unitarity in a
spacetime with two timelike dimensions. What is gained through 2T-physics is a
unification of diverse 1T dynamics by making manifest hidden symmetries and
relationships among them. Such symmetries and relationships is the evidence for
the presence of the underlying higher dimensional spacetime structure.
2T-physics could be viewed as a device for gaining a better understanding of
1T-physics, but beyond this, 2T-physics offers new vistas in the search of the
unified theory while raising deep questions about the meaning of spacetime. In
these lectures, the recent developments in the powerful gauge field theory
formulation of 2T-physics will be described after a brief review of the results
obtained so far in the more intuitive worldline approach.

"In a physics curriculum only introductory physics course grades show
  gender differences but do not predict future course performance for physics
  majors",http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11262v1,"['Kyle M. Whitcomb', 'Chandralekha Singh']","  Analysis of institutional data for physics majors showing predictive
relationships between required mathematics and physics courses in various years
is important for contemplating how the courses build on each other and whether
there is need to make changes to the curriculum for the majors to strengthen
these relationships. We use 15 years of institutional data at a large research
university to investigate how introductory physics and mathematics courses
predict male and female physics majors' performance on required advanced
physics and mathematics courses. We used Structure Equation Modeling (SEM) to
investigate these predictive relationships and find that among introductory and
advanced physics and mathematics courses, there are gender differences in
performance in favor of male students only in the introductory physics courses
after controlling for high school GPA. We found that a measurement invariance
fully holds in a multi-group SEM by gender, so it was possible to carry out
analysis with gender mediated by introductory physics and high school GPA.
Moreover, we find that these introductory physics courses that have gender
differences do not predict performance in advanced physics courses. Also,
introductory mathematics courses predict performance in advanced mathematics
courses which in turn predict performance in advanced physics courses.
Furthermore, apart from the introductory physics courses that do not predict
performance in future physics courses, there is a strong predictive
relationship between the sophomore, junior and senior level physics courses.
