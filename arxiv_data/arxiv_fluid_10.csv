Kinematic Description of Ricci Solitons in Fluid Spacetimes,http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02138v2,['Umber Sheikh'],"  We consider the kinematics of specific fluid spacetimes admitting timelike
congruences of Ricci Solitons. These fluids includes string cloud, string
fluid, perfect fluid, radially symmetric fluid, anisotropic fluid and
relativistic magneto-fluid. Results are obtained and important physical aspects
are discussed.

Symmetric hyperbolic Euler equations for relativistic perfect fluids,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0502233v1,['Ronald A. Walton'],"  The Euler equations governing a relativistic perfect fluid are put into
symmetric hyperbolic form with dependent variables the fluid's specific entropy
plus a generalized velocity vector equal to the fluid's unit relativistic
velocity vector divided pointwise by the fluid's specific enthalpy.

"Metastability and nucleation in the dilute fluid phase of a simple model
  of globular proteins",http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9912199v1,['Richard P. Sear'],"  The dilute fluid phase of model globular proteins is studied. The model
possesses a fluid-fluid transition buried within the fluid-crystal coexistence
region, as do some globular proteins. If this fluid-fluid transition is not
buried deep inside the fluid-crystal coexistence region the crystalline phase
does not nucleate within the dilute fluid. We link this lack of nucleation of
the crystal to the interactions in our model and speculate that similar
interactions between globular proteins are responsible for the difficulty found
in crystallising many globular proteins.

"Supercooled fluid-fluid phase transition in three dimensions from a
  soft-core potential",http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0005184v2,"['G. Franzese', 'G. Malescio', 'A. Skibinsky', 'S. V. Buldyrev', 'H. E. Stanley']","  To study the possibility of a fluid-fluid phase transition, we analyze a
three-dimensional soft-core isotropic potential for a one-component system. We
utilize two independent numerical approaches, (i) integral equation in the
hypernetted-chain approximation and (ii) molecular dynamics simulations, and
find for both approaches a fluid-fluid phase transition as well as the
conventional gas-liquid critical point. We also study the possible existence of
a triple point in the supercooled fluid phase at which three phases---gas,
high-density fluid, and low-density fluid---coexist.

Fluid dynamics and jamming in a dilatant fluid,http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.5063v1,"['Hiizu Nakanishi', 'Namiko Mitarai']","  We present a phenomenological fluid dynamics model for a dilatant fluid, i.e.
a severe shear thickening fluid, by introducing a state variable. The
Navier-Stokes equation is coupled with the state variable field, which evolves
in response to the local shear stress as the fluid is sheared. The viscosity is
assumed to depend upon the state variable and to diverge at a certain value due
to jamming. We demonstrate that the coupling of the fluid dynamics with the
shear thickening leads to an oscillatory instability in the shear flow. The
model also shows a peculiar response of the fluid to a strong external impact.

"The cost of swimming in generalized Newtonian fluids: Experiments with
  C. elegans",http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05811v1,"['David A. Gagnon', 'Paulo E. Arratia']","  Numerous natural processes are contingent on microorganisms' ability to swim
through fluids with non-Newtonian rheology. Here, we use the model organism
Caenorhabditis elegans and tracking methods to experimentally investigate the
dynamics of undulatory swimming in shear-thinning fluids. Theory and simulation
have proposed that the cost of swimming, or mechanical power, should be lower
in a shear-thinning fluid compared to a Newtonian fluid of the same zero-shear
viscosity. We aim to provide an experimental investigation into the cost of
swimming in a shear-thinning fluid from (i) an estimate of the mechanical power
of the swimmer and (ii) the viscous dissipation rate of the flow field, which
should yield equivalent results for a self-propelled low Reynolds number
swimmer. We find the cost of swimming in shear-thinning fluids is less than or
equal to the cost of swimming in Newtonian fluids of the same zero-shear
viscosity; furthermore, the cost of swimming in shear-thinning fluids scales
with a fluid's effective viscosity and can be predicted using fluid rheology
and simple swimming kinematics. Our results agree reasonably well with previous
theoretical predictions and provide a framework for understanding the cost of
swimming in generalized Newtonian fluids.

"On the classification of incompressible fluids and a mathematical
  analysis of the equations that govern their motion",http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04853v2,"['Jan Blechta', 'Josef MÃ¡lek', 'K. R. Rajagopal']","  In the first part of the paper we provide a new classification of
incompressible fluids characterized by a continuous monotone relation between
the velocity gradient and the Cauchy stress. The considered class includes
Euler fluids, Navier-Stokes fluids, classical power-law fluids as well as
stress power-law fluids, and their various generalizations including the fluids
that we refer to as activated fluids, namely fluids that behave as an Euler
fluid prior activation and behave as a viscous fluid once activation takes
place. We also present a classification concerning boundary conditions that are
viewed as the constitutive relations on the boundary. In the second part of the
paper, we develop a robust mathematical theory for activated Euler fluids
associated with different types of the boundary conditions ranging from no-slip
to freeslip and include Navier's slip as well as stick-slip. Both steady and
unsteady flows of such fluids in three-dimensional domains are analyzed.

Stirring faces: mixing in a quiescent fluid,http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.3747v1,"['Steven L. Brunton', 'Clarence W. Rowley']","  This fluid dynamics video depicts the mixing that occurs as a two-dimensional
flat plate plunges sinusoidally in a quiescent fluid. Finite-time Lyapunov
exponents reveal sets that are attracting or repelling. As the flow field
develops, strange faces emerge.
